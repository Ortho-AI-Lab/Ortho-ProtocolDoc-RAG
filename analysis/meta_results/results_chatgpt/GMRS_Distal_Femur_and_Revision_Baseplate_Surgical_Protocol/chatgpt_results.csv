1,"Based on the document titled GMRS Distal Femur and Revision Baseplate Surgical Protocol from Stryker, answer this question: How long is the distal femoral component?",65mm,The small distal femoral component is 52mm long and the standard distal femoral component is 60mm long,1,The respondent's answer does not match the model answer and provides incorrect lengths.
2,"Based on the document titled GMRS Distal Femur and Revision Baseplate Surgical Protocol from Stryker, answer this question: Is there a press fit or cementless option?",Yes,The document specifies that the GMRS cemented stems are designed to be cemented into the medullary canal and does not mention a press fit or cementless option,1,"The respondent's answer is incorrect, as it contradicts the correct answer which confirms that a press fit or cementless option exists."
3,"Based on the document titled GMRS Distal Femur and Revision Baseplate Surgical Protocol from Stryker, answer this question: How do you check rotation?",Should be aligned with linea aspera.,"To check rotation, a mark is made on the anterior cortex of the distal femur in line with the trochlear groove using a straight edge. During implantation, the alignment marking on the implant stem is oriented to this reference mark to guide rotational orientation. Rotation can also be verified during trial evaluation",1,The respondent’s answer incorrectly provides a different technique than the required alignment with the linea aspera.
4,"Based on the document titled GMRS Distal Femur and Revision Baseplate Surgical Protocol from Stryker, answer this question: What is the shortest construct I can use?",76mm without body and 105mm with body,"The shortest construct uses the small distal femoral component (52mm), the small cemented stem (as short as 50mm), and no extension piece",1,"The respondent's answer does not match the required numbers: the model answer specifies 76mm without the body and 105mm with the body, while the response mentions different component lengths that total 102mm, which is incorrect."
5,"Based on the document titled GMRS Distal Femur and Revision Baseplate Surgical Protocol from Stryker, answer this question: What degree do I cut the tibia in?",Zero degrees,"The tibia is cut to produce a resected surface with a neutral slope, which corresponds to 0 degrees",3,"The respondent's answer clearly states that the tibia is cut with a neutral slope corresponding to 0 degrees, which matches the correct answer."

7,"Based on the document titled GMRS Distal Femur and Revision Baseplate Surgical Protocol from Stryker, answer this question: What is the minimum stem diameter?",8mm,The minimum stem diameter is 8mm,3,The respondent provided the correct answer as specified in the model answer.
8,"Based on the document titled GMRS Distal Femur and Revision Baseplate Surgical Protocol from Stryker, answer this question: What are the body segment lengths?","There is only one body segment length of 40mm that is extra-cortical. However, there are multiple extension pieces lengths in 10mm increments to achieve a construct as long as 325mm. This is all found in page 49.","The extra-cortical porous-coated body segment has a 40mm replacement length, and stems without this section have an 11mm replacement length",1,The respondent correctly identifies the 40mm extra-cortical segment but incorrectly adds an 11mm length for stems without this section and fails to mention the multiple 10mm extension pieces up to 325mm.
9,"Based on the document titled GMRS Distal Femur and Revision Baseplate Surgical Protocol from Stryker, answer this question: What is the maximum stem diameter?",17mm is the largest stem diameter for either curved or straight.,The maximum stem diameter is 17mm,3,"The respondent correctly identified the maximum stem diameter as 17mm, matching the model answer."
10,"Based on the document titled GMRS Distal Femur and Revision Baseplate Surgical Protocol from Stryker, answer this question: What are cone sizes?","Symmetric and asymmetric. Each come in sizes A, B, C, D, and E.","The cone sizes are B, C, D, and E; size A is not compatible with the Revision Baseplate",2,The answer provides some correct sizes but omits the symmetric and asymmetric category information and mistakenly excludes size A.
11,"Based on the document titled GMRS Distal Femur and Revision Baseplate Surgical Protocol from Stryker, answer this question: What are the augment sizes on the tibia?",Augments come in 5mm and 10mm increments for each tibial size.,The tibial augment sizes are 5mm and 10mm,3,"The respondent's answer correctly identifies the augment sizes as 5mm and 10mm, matching the model answer."
12,"Based on the document titled GMRS Distal Femur and Revision Baseplate Surgical Protocol from Stryker, answer this question: What’s the minimum total distal femur resection?",The minimum resection length is 76mm,"The minimum total distal femur resection is approximately 4–6mm longer than the prosthesis length to account for tibial resection, with the shortest distal femoral component being 52mm; thus, the minimum resection is approximately 56–58mm",1,The respondent’s answer does not match the correct minimum resection length of 76mm and is therefore incorrect.
13,"Based on the document titled GMRS Distal Femur and Revision Baseplate Surgical Protocol from Stryker, answer this question: Is there a non-nickel containing option?",There is not.,The document does not mention a non-nickel containing option,3,"The respondent correctly identified that the document does not mention a non-nickel containing option, matching the model answer."

15,"Based on the document titled GMRS Distal Femur and Revision Baseplate Surgical Protocol from Stryker, answer this question: What is the minimum reamer I have to use on the femur and tibia?",The minimum reamer is 10mm.,"The minimum reamer diameter for the femur is 10mm to accommodate the smallest 8mm stem (2mm cement mantle), and for the tibia, it is also 8mm using the 8mm Starter Awl",2,"The respondent correctly identifies the femur's minimum reamer as 10mm but incorrectly states that the tibia's is 8mm, which does not match the model answer."
16,"Based on the document titled GMRS Distal Femur and Revision Baseplate Surgical Protocol from Stryker, answer this question: Is there a distal femur resection guide for measurement?","Yes, there is a distal femur resection guide available for measurement in the Stryker Triathlon TS Femur and Revision Baseplate.","Yes, the Distal Femoral Template is used as a resection guide to measure and mark the appropriate resection level on the femur",3,"The respondent correctly identifies that there is a distal femur resection guide available and provides a relevant name, aligning with the established protocol description."
17,"Based on the document titled GMRS Distal Femur and Revision Baseplate Surgical Protocol from Stryker, answer this question: What is the valgus angle of the distal femoral cut?",The valgus angle of the distal femoral cut in the Stryker Triathlon TS Femur and Revision Baseplate is 6 degrees.,"The distal femoral components have a built-in 6° valgus offset, which corresponds to the intended valgus angle of the distal femoral cut",3,The respondent's answer correctly identifies the valgus angle as 6° and aligns with the model answer.
18,"Based on the document titled GMRS Distal Femur and Revision Baseplate Surgical Protocol from Stryker, answer this question: If the knee does not fully extend, what are the steps we evaluate to change the construct?",Cut more distal femur or shorten the construct.,"If the knee does not fully extend, evaluate distal pulses with the knee extended and flexed; if the pulse improves with flexion, assess whether the prosthesis is too long by checking resected bone length against prosthesis length. If too long, options include removing more bone from the femur, shortening the prosthesis, using a thinner insert, or, if those affect patellar tracking, removing bone from the tibia instead",2,"The respondent's answer mentions shortening the construct (by removing more bone from the femur and shortening the prosthesis), which aligns with the correct answer, but it also includes extra evaluation steps (such as assessing distal pulses) that go beyond the model answer."
19,"Based on the document titled GMRS Distal Femur and Revision Baseplate Surgical Protocol from Stryker, answer this question: If the knee is too recurvatum in flexion and extension, what are the steps we evaluate to change the construct? What can we do with the bumper in this scenario?",Lengthen the construct.,"If the knee is too recurvatum in flexion and extension, assess leg length, patellar tracking, and extension gap. Consider using a thicker insert or adjusting femoral/tibial resection to reduce laxity. The bumper can be changed to a 3° flexion bumper to reduce hyperextension and improve stability",1,"The respondent's answer does not match the model answer, as it does not mention ""lengthening the construct"" and introduces additional unsupported steps."
20,"Based on the document titled GMRS Distal Femur and Revision Baseplate Surgical Protocol from Stryker, answer this question: If the patella is laterally dislocating, what can be done to modify the tibia?",Externally rotate the tibia or consider externally rotating the femoral component.,"If the patella is laterally dislocating, slight external rotation of the tibial component may aid in improving patellar tracking",3,"The respondent correctly suggests externally rotating the tibial component, which matches the model answer."
21,"Based on the document titled GMRS Distal Femur and Revision Baseplate Surgical Protocol from Stryker, answer this question: What are the choices for the tibial component in the setting of a distal femur fracture? How do I decide which is the best option?",The revision baseplate or MRH baseplate.,"The tibial component options include the Triathlon Revision Baseplate with or without cemented or fluted stems, and optional cone augments. The best option is determined based on bone quality, presence of bone voids, and need for fixation length; cemented stems are preferred if offsetting or poor bone stock exists, and cone augments are used when metaphyseal support is needed",1,The respondent's answer does not match the model answer and introduces an entirely different tibial component system with additional details that are not part of the correct answer.
22,"Based on the document titled GMRS Distal Femur and Revision Baseplate Surgical Protocol from Stryker, answer this question: If I can’t get diaphyseal fixation in the femur, what are the options?",Cement the femoral component.,"If diaphyseal fixation in the femur cannot be achieved, options include using an extension piece to lengthen the construct and engaging the extra-cortical porous-coated body segment, which provides 40mm of additional fixation length",1,"The respondent's answer does not match the model answer and includes details (extension piece and porous-coated segment) that are not part of the correct answer ""Cement the femoral component."""
23,"Based on the document titled GMRS Distal Femur and Revision Baseplate Surgical Protocol from Stryker, answer this question: When should a distal femoral replacement be used or considered?","A distal femoral replacement should be used or considered in the following situations: 1. **Severe Bone Loss**: When there is significant bone loss in the distal femur due to trauma, tumor resection, or infection that cannot be adequately addressed with other fixation methods. 2. **Non-Union or Malunion**: In cases where there is a non-union or malunion of the distal femur that cannot be corrected with traditional fixation techniques. 3. **Complex Fractures**: For complex fractures of the distal femur that involve significant comminution or instability, where standard fixation methods may not provide sufficient stability. 4. **Revision Surgery**: In revision surgeries where previous implants have failed, and there is a need for a more stable and robust solution. 5. **Tumor Resection**: Following the resection of tumors in the distal femur, where reconstruction is necessary to restore limb function and stability. 6. **Infection**: In cases of chronic infection that have led to bone loss or instability, a distal femoral replacement may be necessary to manage the condition effectively. In these scenarios, a distal femoral replacement can provide a stable and functional solution, allowing for improved mobility and quality of life for the patient.","A distal femoral replacement should be used or considered for reconstruction of large segmental defects due to tumors, failed previous arthroplasty, or trauma",2,"The respondent's answer partially addresses the question by mentioning tumors, failed arthroplasty, and trauma, but it misses other important conditions such as severe bone loss, non-union/malunion, and complex fractures."
24,"Based on the document titled GMRS Distal Femur and Revision Baseplate Surgical Protocol from Stryker, answer this question: What can I do with the distal femoral component if I can’t close the retinaculum?","Shorten the construct, rotate the component, or remove the patella.","If the retinaculum cannot be closed, additional bone can be removed from the tibia rather than the femur to avoid negatively affecting patellar tracking",1,"The respondent's answer is incorrect because it does not mention shortening the construct, rotating the component, or removing the patella, and instead suggests an unrelated modification to the tibia."
25,"Based on the document titled GMRS Distal Femur and Revision Baseplate Surgical Protocol from Stryker, answer this question: If I have patellar impingement on the mechanism, what are my choices to modify the construct?","Shorten the construct, rotate the component, or remove the patella.","If there is patellar impingement on the mechanism, options to modify the construct include adjusting the femoral rotation (e.g., slight external rotation), revising the patellar component, or resurfacing the patella if not already done to improve tracking and clearance",2,"The respondent's answer partially meets the model answer by including a rotation option, but it fails to mention shortening the construct and incorrectly substitutes removal of the patella with resurfacing or revising the patellar component."
26,"Based on the document titled GMRS Distal Femur and Revision Baseplate Surgical Protocol from Stryker, answer this question: What are the bumper and poly options in my construct?","Neutral or 3 degree bumper. 11, 13, 16, 19, 22 mm poly.","The bumper options are neutral (0°) and 3° flexion bumpers; the poly (Hinge Insert) options come in sizes 11mm, 13mm, 16mm, 19mm, and 22mm for each baseplate size 1 through 7",3,"The respondent correctly identifies the bumper options and lists the poly sizes, aligning well with the model answer details."
27,"Based on the document titled GMRS Distal Femur and Revision Baseplate Surgical Protocol from Stryker, answer this question: Is this a central femoral hinge or posterior consular hinge? Which has better quad efficiency and lower dislocation rate?","The Stryker Triathlon TS Femur and Revision Baseplate utilizes a **central femoral hinge** design. This design is known to provide better quadriceps efficiency and a lower dislocation rate compared to a posterior condylar hinge. The central femoral hinge allows for more natural knee mechanics, contributing to improved function and stability.",The document describes a central femoral hinge design. It does not compare quad efficiency or dislocation rates between central and posterior condylar hinge types,2,The respondent correctly identifies the hinge as a central femoral hinge but does not address the comparison in quad efficiency and dislocation rates.
28,"Based on the document titled GMRS Distal Femur and Revision Baseplate Surgical Protocol from Stryker, answer this question: Is there an all poly tibial baseplate option if I wanted to use it as a spacer?","Yes, there is an all-poly tibial baseplate option available in the Stryker Triathlon TS Femur and Revision Baseplate that can be used as a spacer. This option is designed to provide stability and support while allowing for flexibility in surgical planning.",The document does not mention an all-poly tibial baseplate option for use as a spacer.,1,The respondent's answer is incorrect because it contradicts the document which states an all-poly tibial baseplate option is available.
