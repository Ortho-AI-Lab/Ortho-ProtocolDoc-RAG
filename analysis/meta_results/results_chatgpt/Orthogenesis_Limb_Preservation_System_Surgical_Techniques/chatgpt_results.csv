3,"Based on the document titled Orthogenesis Limb Preservation System Surgical Techniques from DePuy, answer this question: How do you check rotation?","To check rotation in the DePuy Orthogenesis Limb Preservation System Surgical Techniques, you can use the following method: 1. **Visual Inspection**: Observe the alignment of the limb in relation to the pelvis and the foot. 2. **Clinical Examination**: Assess the position of the patella and the foot to ensure they are aligned correctly. 3. **Radiographic Evaluation**: Use imaging techniques to confirm the rotational alignment of the components. These steps help ensure that the rotation is within the desired parameters for optimal function.","Rotation is checked by marking the femur for reference. In proximal femoral replacement, the surgeon marks the anterior femoral cortex with a vertical line distal to the resection line and uses the linea aspera as a guide. During trialing, once proper anteversion is set, the anti-rotation slot (tab) on the trial is aligned and used to mark the femur; this mark serves as a guide for final implant insertion. In distal femoral replacement, a vertical line is marked on the anterior cortex in line with the femoral trochlear groove, and the anti-rotation slot on the trial is used for final alignment.",1,"The respondent's answer explains a different technique using femoral markings and anti-rotation slots instead of the visual, clinical, and radiographic methods described in the model answer."
