If you need more detailed information about the poly options, it may be found in other parts of the document not included in the query.",2,"The respondent's answer provides partial information by mentioning bumper options, but these do not match the expected ""neutral or 3 degree bumper"" and it completely omits the correct poly options (11, 13, 16, 19, 22 mm), making the answer incomplete."
27,"Based on the document titled GMRS Distal Femur and Revision Baseplate Surgical Protocol from Stryker, answer this question: Is this a central femoral hinge or posterior consular hinge? Which has better quad efficiency and lower dislocation rate?","The Stryker Triathlon TS Femur and Revision Baseplate utilizes a **central femoral hinge** design. This design is known to provide better quadriceps efficiency and a lower dislocation rate compared to a posterior condylar hinge. The central femoral hinge allows for more natural knee mechanics, contributing to improved function and stability.","The document does not specify whether the hinge is a central femoral hinge or a posterior condylar hinge, nor does it provide a comparison of quad efficiency and dislocation rates between the two types. The focus is on surgical procedures and component compatibility, without detailing the type of hinge mechanism. Therefore, I cannot determine the type of hinge or provide a comparison based on the available content.",1,"The respondent incorrectly states that the document does not contain the relevant information, while the correct answer clearly identifies the hinge as a central femoral hinge with better quad efficiency and lower dislocation rates."
28,"Based on the document titled GMRS Distal Femur and Revision Baseplate Surgical Protocol from Stryker, answer this question: Is there an all poly tibial baseplate option if I wanted to use it as a spacer?","Yes, there is an all-poly tibial baseplate option available in the Stryker Triathlon TS Femur and Revision Baseplate that can be used as a spacer. This option is designed to provide stability and support while allowing for flexibility in surgical planning.","The document does not mention an all-poly tibial baseplate option available for use as a spacer. The images focus on compatibility and technical details of various components but do not specify such an option. Therefore, based on the available content, there is no indication of an all-poly tibial baseplate option.",1,"The respondent's answer directly contradicts the correct answer by stating that the option is not mentioned, which is an incorrect response."
