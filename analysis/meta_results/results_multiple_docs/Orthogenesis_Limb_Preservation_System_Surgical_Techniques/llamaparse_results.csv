2. **Check Segmental Trials**: If the segmental trials used are at the minimum length of 25 mm and the joint line appears too far distal, consider recutting the femoral osteotomy to adjust for the discrepancy.

3. **Re-reaming**: If the femoral cut is revised, re-ream the femur more proximally and finish the osteotomized surface with a calcar planer/bevel reamer to ensure proper fit and avoid intraoperative fractures.

4. **Adjust Tibial Insert Heights**: Varying the hinged tibial insert trial heights can affect leg length. Use the trial construct to assess proper component rotational orientation.

5. **Mark Alignment**: Once proper orientation is established, use the anti-rotation slot (tab) on the trial as a reference to mark the femur, which will serve as an alignment guide when inserting the final implant.

These steps help ensure that the construct is adjusted appropriately to allow for full knee extension.",2,"The respondent's answer provides some steps related to adjusting the construct (e.g., alignment and component adjustments), but it deviates significantly from the model answer by not addressing soft tissue tension or bony impingement and focusing on different intraoperative steps."
19,"Based on the document titled Orthogenesis Limb Preservation System Surgical Techniques from DePuy, answer this question: If the knee is too recurvatum in flexion and extension, what are the steps we evaluate to change the construct? What can we do with the bumper in this scenario?","If the knee is too recurvatum in flexion and extension in the DePuy Orthogenesis Limb Preservation System, the following steps should be evaluated to change the construct: 1. **Assess Component Positioning**: Check the positioning of the femoral and tibial components to ensure they are correctly aligned and not contributing to the recurvatum deformity. 2. **Evaluate Soft Tissue Balance**: Examine the soft tissue around the knee, including ligaments and tendons, to determine if there is an imbalance that may be causing the recurvatum. 3. **Check for Bony Impingement**: Look for any bony impingement that may be affecting the knee's range of motion and contributing to the recurvatum. 4. **Adjust the Construct**: Based on the assessment, consider adjusting the length or positioning of the components to correct the recurvatum. This may involve changing the angle of the cuts or the alignment of the components. 5. **Reassess Range of Motion**: After making adjustments, reassess the knee's range of motion to ensure that the recurvatum has been addressed. Regarding the bumper in this scenario, the bumper can be adjusted or replaced to provide better support and stability to the knee joint. It can help in managing the soft tissue tension and improving the overall alignment of the knee, thereby aiding in the correction of the recurvatum deformity.","If the knee is too recurvatum in flexion and extension, the following steps should be evaluated to change the construct:

1. **Assess Joint Line**: Compare the knee joint line to the opposite side to ensure proper height. The joint line is determined by the level of the femoral component.

2. **Recut Femoral Osteotomy**: If the segmental trials used are at the minimum length of 25 mm and the joint line is too far distal, consider recutting the femoral osteotomy to adjust for the discrepancy.

3. **Re-reaming**: If the femoral cut is revised, re-ream the femur more proximally and finish the osteotomized surface with a calcar planer/bevel reamer to ensure proper fit and avoid intraoperative fractures.

4. **Adjust Tibial Insert Heights**: Varying the hinged tibial insert trial heights can affect leg length. Use the trial construct to assess proper component rotational orientation.

5. **Mark Alignment**: Once proper orientation is established, use the anti-rotation slot (tab) on the trial as a reference to mark the femur, which will serve as an alignment guide when inserting the final implant.

Regarding the bumper in this scenario, if the knee is too recurvatum, adjustments may be made to the bumper to help stabilize the knee joint and improve the overall alignment and function of the construct. Specific adjustments to the bumper would depend on the individual case and the surgeon's assessment.",2,"The respondent's answer includes some adjustments to the bumper similar to the model answer but lists a different set of construct modifications (e.g., recutting the femoral osteotomy, re-reaming, and adjusting tibial insert heights) that do not fully align with the key evaluation steps (such as assessing component positioning, soft tissue balance, and bony impingement) given in the model answer."
20,"Based on the document titled Orthogenesis Limb Preservation System Surgical Techniques from DePuy, answer this question: If the patella is laterally dislocating, what can be done to modify the tibia?","If the patella is laterally dislocating in the DePuy Orthogenesis Limb Preservation System, the following modifications can be made to the tibia: 1. **Tibial Tuberosity Transfer**: Consider transferring the tibial tuberosity medially to realign the patellar tracking and reduce lateral dislocation. 2. **Adjusting the Tibial Cut**: Modify the angle of the tibial cut to improve the alignment of the patellar tracking. This may involve changing the orientation to create a more favorable angle for the patella. 3. **Using a Lateral Release**: If necessary, perform a lateral release of the retinaculum to relieve tension on the lateral structures that may be contributing to the dislocation. 4. **Evaluate Soft Tissue Balance**: Assess the soft tissue around the knee, including the iliotibial band and lateral retinaculum, and make adjustments as needed to improve the balance and support for the patella. 5. **Reassess Patellar Tracking**: After making these modifications, reassess the patellar tracking to ensure that the changes have effectively addressed the lateral dislocation. These steps aim to improve the alignment and stability of the patella, reducing the risk of dislocation.","If the patella is laterally dislocating, the following modifications can be made to the tibia:

1. **Tibial Preparation**: Ensure proper preparation of the proximal tibia using appropriate instrumentation, such as intra-medullary or extramedullary guides. This helps in achieving the correct alignment and positioning of the tibial component.

2. **Use of Hinged Tibial Insert**: When using the S-ROM tibial tray, it is important to use the S-ROM hinged tibial insert bearing. This can help stabilize the knee joint and prevent lateral dislocation of the patella.

3. **Resurfacing the Patella**: Consider resurfacing the patella with a dome patella replacement component, such as the S-ROM or Sigma dome patella component. This can help improve the tracking of the patella and reduce the likelihood of dislocation.

4. **Soft Tissue Management**: Evaluate and manage the soft tissue integrity around the knee. If there is inadequate soft tissue support, consider surgical techniques to reinforce or reposition soft tissues to improve stability.

These steps aim to enhance the stability of the knee joint and prevent lateral dislocation of the patella.",1,"The respondent's answer does not address the specific modifications to the tibia described in the model answer and instead includes irrelevant details like tibial preparation, use of a hinged tibial insert, and patella resurfacing."
21,"Based on the document titled Orthogenesis Limb Preservation System Surgical Techniques from DePuy, answer this question: What are the choices for the tibial component in the setting of a distal femur fracture? How do I decide which is the best option?","In the setting of a distal femur fracture, the choices for the tibial component in the DePuy Orthogenesis Limb Preservation System include: 1. **Standard Tibial Component**: This is typically used for most cases and provides a stable foundation for the limb. 2. **Augmented Tibial Component**: This option is used when there is significant bone loss or deformity that requires additional support. 3. **Cemented Tibial Component**: This may be chosen for patients with poor bone quality or when additional fixation is needed. To decide which is the best option, consider the following factors: - **Bone Quality**: Assess the quality and quantity of the bone in the tibia. Poor bone quality may necessitate a cemented option or an augmented component. - **Extent of the Fracture**: Evaluate the severity and location of the distal femur fracture. If there is significant displacement or instability, an augmented component may provide better support. - **Patient Factors**: Consider the patient's age, activity level, and overall health. Younger, more active patients may benefit from a standard component, while older patients with lower activity levels may require a more stable option. - **Surgeon's Preference and Experience**: The surgeon's familiarity with the components and their outcomes can also influence the choice. By evaluating these factors, the most appropriate tibial component can be selected to optimize the surgical outcome.","In the setting of a distal femur fracture, the choices for the tibial component include:

1. **S-ROM Hinged Tibial Insert Bearing**: This is used with the S-ROM tibial tray.
2. **Orthogenesis LPS Hinged Tibial Insert Bearing**: This is used with the M.B.T. revision tibial tray.

To decide which is the best option, consider the following factors:

- **Compatibility**: Ensure that the tibial insert matches the femoral component being used. For example, use the LPS extra-small hinged tibial insert bearing sizes to match the Orthogenesis LPS extra-small Distal Femoral Replacement component.

- **Patient-Specific Factors**: Evaluate the patient's anatomy, the extent of the fracture, and any pre-existing conditions that may affect the choice of the tibial component.

- **Surgical Technique**: The choice may also depend on the surgical approach and the specific instrumentation available for the procedure.

- **Functional Requirements**: Consider the desired range of motion and stability required for the patient's rehabilitation and functional outcomes.

By assessing these factors, the surgeon can determine the most appropriate tibial component for the specific clinical scenario.",1,"The respondent's answer lists different tibial components than those specified in the model answer and does not address the decision criteria (e.g., standard, augmented, cemented based on bone quality, fracture extent, patient factors, etc.) as required."
22,"Based on the document titled Orthogenesis Limb Preservation System Surgical Techniques from DePuy, answer this question: If I can’t get diaphyseal fixation in the femur, what are the options?",Cement the implant.,"If diaphyseal fixation in the femur cannot be achieved, the following options may be considered:

1. **Use of Cemented Stems**: If adequate bone quality is not available for mechanical fixation, cemented stems can provide stability. Ensure that the stem is properly aligned and that excess cement is removed from the junction between the stem collar and bone.

2. **Intercalary Constructs**: Consider using an intercalary construct that can bridge the gap between the proximal and distal femur. This construct can be secured with locking pins and cement to enhance stability.

3. **Soft Tissue Reconstruction**: If there is inadequate soft tissue coverage due to previous resections, mobilizing remaining musculature may be necessary to achieve proper coverage around the prosthesis.

4. **Alternative Fixation Techniques**: Depending on the specific clinical scenario, alternative fixation methods such as using plates or external fixators may be considered to provide additional support.

5. **Evaluate for Additional Procedures**: In some cases, additional surgical procedures may be necessary to enhance fixation or stability, such as bone grafting or the use of adjunctive devices.

These options should be evaluated based on the individual patient's anatomy, the extent of the fracture, and the overall surgical plan.",2,"The respondent correctly mentioned using cement (cemented stems), but they added extra options that were not part of the model answer."
23,"Based on the document titled Orthogenesis Limb Preservation System Surgical Techniques from DePuy, answer this question: When should a distal femoral replacement be used or considered?","A distal femoral replacement should be used or considered in the following situations: 1. **Severe Bone Loss**: When there is significant bone loss in the distal femur due to trauma, tumor resection, or infection that cannot be adequately addressed with other fixation methods. 2. **Non-Union or Malunion**: In cases where there is a non-union or malunion of the distal femur that cannot be corrected with traditional fixation techniques. 3. **Complex Fractures**: For complex fractures of the distal femur that involve significant comminution or instability, where standard fixation methods may not provide sufficient stability. 4. **Revision Surgery**: In revision surgeries where previous implants have failed, and there is a need for a more stable and robust solution. 5. **Tumor Resection**: Following the resection of tumors in the distal femur, where reconstruction is necessary to restore limb function and stability. 6. **Infection**: In cases of chronic infection that have led to bone loss or instability, a distal femoral replacement may be necessary to manage the condition effectively. In these scenarios, a distal femoral replacement can provide a stable and functional solution, allowing for improved mobility and quality of life for the patient.","A distal femoral replacement should be used or considered in the following scenarios:

1. **Bone Tumors**: When there is a need to resect a portion of the distal femur due to primary bone sarcoma or metastatic disease.

2. **Severe Fractures**: In cases of complex or non-union fractures of the distal femur where traditional fixation methods are inadequate.

3. **Significant Bone Loss**: When there is substantial bone loss in the distal femur that cannot be adequately addressed with other reconstructive techniques.

4. **Failed Previous Surgeries**: In situations where previous surgical interventions have failed, leading to instability or deformity in the distal femur.

5. **Intraoperative Findings**: If intraoperative assessment reveals that the remaining bone is insufficient for stable fixation or reconstruction.

In making the decision, factors such as the patient's overall health, activity level, and specific anatomical considerations should be evaluated, along with preoperative imaging studies to determine the extent of resection needed.",3,"The respondent's answer correctly identifies key scenarios—bone tumors, severe fractures, significant bone loss, and failed previous surgeries—and even adds intraoperative findings as a consideration, which aligns well with the model answer's indications."
24,"Based on the document titled Orthogenesis Limb Preservation System Surgical Techniques from DePuy, answer this question: What can I do with the distal femoral component if I can’t close the retinaculum?",Change your implant or shorten the construct.,"If you cannot close the retinaculum after placing the distal femoral component, consider the following options:

1. **Soft Tissue Management**: Evaluate the soft tissue integrity around the knee. If there is inadequate soft tissue coverage, you may need to mobilize remaining musculature to achieve proper closure.

2. **Suture Techniques**: Use sutures to reattach any available soft tissue structures, such as the iliopsoas muscle or vastus lateralis, to the appropriate anatomical locations. This can help provide additional support and stability.

3. **Knee Positioning**: If soft tissue integrity is compromised, consider closing the wound with the knee in full extension to minimize tension on the retinaculum.

4. **Use of Drains**: Insert a suction drain to help manage any potential hematoma formation, which can occur due to extensive dissection.

5. **Postoperative Care**: Implement a postoperative care plan that includes monitoring for complications and ensuring that the knee is stabilized appropriately, possibly with a brace if necessary.

These steps aim to enhance the stability of the knee joint and ensure proper healing after surgery.",1,"The respondent's answer does not mention changing the implant or shortening the construct, which is the model answer, and instead provides unrelated soft tissue management strategies."
25,"Based on the document titled Orthogenesis Limb Preservation System Surgical Techniques from DePuy, answer this question: If I have patellar impingement on the mechanism, what are my choices to modify the construct?","If there is patellar impingement on the mechanism in the DePuy Orthogenesis Limb Preservation System, the following choices can be considered to modify the construct: 1. **Adjust the Position of the Patellar Component**: Reassess and potentially reposition the patellar component to ensure it is aligned properly and not causing impingement. 2. **Modify the Femoral Component**: If the femoral component is contributing to the impingement, consider adjusting its position or orientation to alleviate the pressure on the patella. 3. **Increase the Patellar Thickness**: If feasible, using a thicker patellar component may help in reducing the impingement by providing better clearance. 4. **Perform a Lateral Release**: If the lateral structures are tight, a lateral release may help reduce tension and allow for better patellar tracking, thereby alleviating impingement. 5. **Evaluate Soft Tissue Tension**: Assess the surrounding soft tissues for any excessive tension that may be contributing to the impingement and make necessary adjustments. 6. **Consider a Different Patellar Design**: If the current design is not suitable, consider using a different patellar design that may provide better clearance and reduce the risk of impingement. 7. **Reassess the Overall Alignment**: Ensure that the overall alignment of the limb is correct, as malalignment can contribute to patellar impingement. These modifications aim to alleviate the impingement and improve the function of the knee joint while maintaining the stability of the construct.","If there is patellar impingement on the mechanism, the following choices can be considered to modify the construct:

1. **Adjust Component Positioning**: Reassess the alignment and positioning of the tibial and femoral components. Ensure that the anti-rotation slots are properly aligned and that the components are positioned to minimize impingement.

2. **Modify the Tibial Insert Height**: Vary the height of the hinged tibial insert trial to see if a different height alleviates the impingement. This can help in achieving better patellar tracking.

3. **Resurface the Patella**: If not already done, consider resurfacing the patella with a dome patella replacement component to improve its tracking and reduce impingement.

4. **Soft Tissue Management**: Evaluate the soft tissue around the knee joint. If there is excessive tension or inadequate soft tissue coverage, consider mobilizing or reconstructing the soft tissues to improve stability and alignment.

5. **Re-evaluate the Bumper**: If applicable, adjustments to the bumper may help in stabilizing the knee joint and improving the overall function of the construct.

6. **Trial Reduction**: Perform a final trial reduction to assess joint stability and patellar tracking before finalizing the implant components.

These modifications aim to enhance the function of the knee joint and reduce the risk of patellar impingement.",2,"The respondent provides some modifications to address patellar impingement, but their answer includes options not found in the model and omits several key modifications such as modifying femoral component position, increasing patellar thickness, performing a lateral release, and reassessing overall limb alignment."
26,"Based on the document titled Orthogenesis Limb Preservation System Surgical Techniques from DePuy, answer this question: What are the bumper and poly options in my construct?","No bumper. Poly sizes are 12, 14, 16, 18, 20, 22, 24, 26, 28mm","The document does not provide specific details on the bumper and poly options in the construct. However, it mentions the following related to tibial components:

1. **Tibial Inserts**: 
   - When using the S-ROM tibial tray, the S-ROM hinged tibial insert bearing should be used.
   - When using the M.B.T. revision tibial tray, the Orthogenesis LPS hinged tibial insert bearing is recommended.

2. **Patellar Resurfacing**: It is suggested to resurface the patella using a dome patella replacement component, such as the S-ROM or Sigma dome patella component.

For specific bumper and poly options, it may be necessary to refer to additional resources or product catalogs related to the Orthogenesis Limb Preservation System for detailed specifications and choices available.",1,The respondent's answer fails to mention the required options (no bumper and specific poly sizes) and instead delivers unrelated details about tibial components and patellar resurfacing.
27,"Based on the document titled Orthogenesis Limb Preservation System Surgical Techniques from DePuy, answer this question: Is this a central femoral hinge or posterior consular hinge? Which has better quad efficiency and lower dislocation rate?",Posterior condylar hinge. The central femoral hinge has better quad efficiency and lower dislocation rate.,"The document does not explicitly state whether the system uses a central femoral hinge or a posterior condylar hinge. However, it discusses the importance of proper alignment and stability in the context of knee mechanics.

In general, posterior condylar hinges are often associated with better quadriceps efficiency and lower dislocation rates compared to central femoral hinges. This is due to the anatomical alignment and biomechanics that allow for more natural movement and stability during flexion and extension.

For specific information regarding the hinge type used in the Orthogenesis Limb Preservation System and their comparative performance, it may be necessary to consult additional resources or product specifications from DePuy.",1,The respondent's answer is incorrect because it fails to identify the system as using a posterior condylar hinge as stated in the document and reverses the performance comparison given in the model answer.
28,"Based on the document titled Orthogenesis Limb Preservation System Surgical Techniques from DePuy, answer this question: Is there an all poly tibial baseplate option if I wanted to use it as a spacer?",No.,"The document does not explicitly mention specific options for an all-poly tibial baseplate to be used as a spacer. However, it discusses the use of various tibial components, including:

1. **S-ROM Hinged Tibial Insert Bearing**: This is used with the S-ROM tibial tray.
2. **Orthogenesis LPS Hinged Tibial Insert Bearing**: This is used with the M.B.T. revision tibial tray.

For specific options regarding an all-poly tibial baseplate, it may be necessary to consult additional resources or product catalogs related to the Orthogenesis Limb Preservation System to determine if such an option is available and suitable for use as a spacer.",3,"The response correctly identifies that the document does not mention an option for an all-poly tibial baseplate as a spacer, which aligns with the correct answer."
