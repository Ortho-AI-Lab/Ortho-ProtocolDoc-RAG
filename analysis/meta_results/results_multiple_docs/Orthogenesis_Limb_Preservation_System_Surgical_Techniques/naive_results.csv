2. **Evaluate Leg Length**: If the leg length is slightly long and the implant’s offset is excessive, consider using a shorter trial femoral head.

3. **Adjust Segmental Trials**: If the soft tissues are tight but the femoral offset is acceptable, try reducing the vertical height or leg length by adjusting the segmental trials.

4. **Recut Femoral Osteotomy**: If the segmental trials used are at the minimum length of 25 mm and the leg length is still long, consider recutting the femoral osteotomy to adjust for the discrepancy.

5. **Re-ream the Femur**: If the femoral cut is revised, re-ream the femur more proximally and finish the osteotomized surface with a calcar planer/bevel reamer to ensure proper fit and avoid intraoperative fractures.

6. **Check for Excessive Soft Tissue Tension**: A test for excessive soft tissue tension is to extend the hip and try flexing the knee. If the hip flexes when the knee flexes, the soft tissue tension may be excessive.

7. **Use Trial Constructs**: Use the trial construct to assess proper femoral anteversion and ensure that the alignment is correct.

These steps help in evaluating and adjusting the construct to achieve proper knee extension and alignment.",2,"The respondent correctly discusses soft tissue tension and construct adjustments but omits key elements such as assessing alignment, checking for bony impingement, and re‐evaluating the range of motion as outlined in the model answer."
19,"Based on the document titled Orthogenesis Limb Preservation System Surgical Techniques from DePuy, answer this question: If the knee is too recurvatum in flexion and extension, what are the steps we evaluate to change the construct? What can we do with the bumper in this scenario?","If the knee is too recurvatum in flexion and extension in the DePuy Orthogenesis Limb Preservation System, the following steps should be evaluated to change the construct: 1. **Assess Component Positioning**: Check the positioning of the femoral and tibial components to ensure they are correctly aligned and not contributing to the recurvatum deformity. 2. **Evaluate Soft Tissue Balance**: Examine the soft tissue around the knee, including ligaments and tendons, to determine if there is an imbalance that may be causing the recurvatum. 3. **Check for Bony Impingement**: Look for any bony impingement that may be affecting the knee's range of motion and contributing to the recurvatum. 4. **Adjust the Construct**: Based on the assessment, consider adjusting the length or positioning of the components to correct the recurvatum. This may involve changing the angle of the cuts or the alignment of the components. 5. **Reassess Range of Motion**: After making adjustments, reassess the knee's range of motion to ensure that the recurvatum has been addressed. Regarding the bumper in this scenario, the bumper can be adjusted or replaced to provide better support and stability to the knee joint. It can help in managing the soft tissue tension and improving the overall alignment of the knee, thereby aiding in the correction of the recurvatum deformity.","If the knee is too recurvatum in flexion and extension, the following steps should be evaluated to change the construct:

1. **Assess Joint Line Height**: Compare the knee joint line to the opposite side to ensure proper height. The joint line is determined by the level of the femoral component.

2. **Evaluate Segmental Trials**: If the segmental trials used are at the minimum length of 25 mm and the joint line is too far distal, consider recutting the femoral osteotomy to adjust for the discrepancy.

3. **Re-ream the Femur**: If the femoral cut is revised, re-ream the femur more proximally and finish the osteotomized surface with a calcar planer/bevel reamer to ensure proper fit and avoid intraoperative fractures.

4. **Adjust Tibial Insert Heights**: Varying the hinged tibial insert trial heights can affect leg length and knee alignment. Adjust these heights as necessary.

5. **Use Trial Constructs**: Use the trial construct to assess proper component rotational orientation and ensure that the alignment is correct.

Regarding the bumper in this scenario, if the knee is too recurvatum, adjustments to the bumper may be necessary to help stabilize the knee joint and improve its function. The specific adjustments would depend on the individual case and the surgeon's assessment of the knee's stability and alignment.",2,"The respondent provides steps for construct adjustments and mentions bumper adjustments but does not align with the specific evaluations (like component positioning, soft tissue balance, and bony impingement) and reassessment outlined in the model answer."
20,"Based on the document titled Orthogenesis Limb Preservation System Surgical Techniques from DePuy, answer this question: If the patella is laterally dislocating, what can be done to modify the tibia?","If the patella is laterally dislocating in the DePuy Orthogenesis Limb Preservation System, the following modifications can be made to the tibia: 1. **Tibial Tuberosity Transfer**: Consider transferring the tibial tuberosity medially to realign the patellar tracking and reduce lateral dislocation. 2. **Adjusting the Tibial Cut**: Modify the angle of the tibial cut to improve the alignment of the patellar tracking. This may involve changing the orientation to create a more favorable angle for the patella. 3. **Using a Lateral Release**: If necessary, perform a lateral release of the retinaculum to relieve tension on the lateral structures that may be contributing to the dislocation. 4. **Evaluate Soft Tissue Balance**: Assess the soft tissue around the knee, including the iliotibial band and lateral retinaculum, and make adjustments as needed to improve the balance and support for the patella. 5. **Reassess Patellar Tracking**: After making these modifications, reassess the patellar tracking to ensure that the changes have effectively addressed the lateral dislocation. These steps aim to improve the alignment and stability of the patella, reducing the risk of dislocation.","If the patella is laterally dislocating, the following modifications can be made to the tibia:

1. **Adjust the Tibial Component**: Ensure that the tibial component is properly aligned. The alignment can be adjusted to help stabilize the patella and prevent lateral dislocation.

2. **Use a Bumper**: The bumper can be modified or adjusted to provide better support and alignment for the patella. This may involve changing the height or position of the bumper to help keep the patella centered in the trochlear groove.

3. **Resurface the Patella**: Consider resurfacing the patella using a dome patella replacement component, such as the S-ROM or Sigma dome patella component, to improve tracking and stability.

4. **Evaluate Soft Tissue Integrity**: Assess the integrity of the surrounding soft tissues, including the iliopsoas and vastus lateralis muscles, and make any necessary adjustments to their attachments to improve stability.

5. **Reassess the Joint Line**: Compare the knee joint line to the opposite side for proper height and make adjustments as necessary to ensure that the joint line is level.

These steps can help address the issue of lateral dislocation of the patella and improve overall knee stability.",2,"The respondent makes an attempt by mentioning tibial component adjustments, but their answer diverges from the specific tibial modifications (like the tibial tuberosity transfer or adjusting the tibial cut) outlined in the model answer and includes extraneous points not directly related to modifying the tibia."
21,"Based on the document titled Orthogenesis Limb Preservation System Surgical Techniques from DePuy, answer this question: What are the choices for the tibial component in the setting of a distal femur fracture? How do I decide which is the best option?","In the setting of a distal femur fracture, the choices for the tibial component in the DePuy Orthogenesis Limb Preservation System include: 1. **Standard Tibial Component**: This is typically used for most cases and provides a stable foundation for the limb. 2. **Augmented Tibial Component**: This option is used when there is significant bone loss or deformity that requires additional support. 3. **Cemented Tibial Component**: This may be chosen for patients with poor bone quality or when additional fixation is needed. To decide which is the best option, consider the following factors: - **Bone Quality**: Assess the quality and quantity of the bone in the tibia. Poor bone quality may necessitate a cemented option or an augmented component. - **Extent of the Fracture**: Evaluate the severity and location of the distal femur fracture. If there is significant displacement or instability, an augmented component may provide better support. - **Patient Factors**: Consider the patient's age, activity level, and overall health. Younger, more active patients may benefit from a standard component, while older patients with lower activity levels may require a more stable option. - **Surgeon's Preference and Experience**: The surgeon's familiarity with the components and their outcomes can also influence the choice. By evaluating these factors, the most appropriate tibial component can be selected to optimize the surgical outcome.","In the setting of a distal femur fracture, the choices for the tibial component include:

1. **S-ROM Hinged Tibial Insert Bearing**: This is specifically designed for use with the S-ROM knee system. It is important to use the correct insert bearing that matches the femoral component being used.

2. **Mobile Bearing Tibial (M.B.T.) Revision Knee System**: This system also offers options for tibial components that can be utilized depending on the specific needs of the patient and the surgical situation.

3. **Orthogenesis LPS Hinged Tibial Insert Bearing**: This is used with the M.B.T. revision tibial tray and is designed to match the Orthogenesis LPS distal femoral replacement component.

### Deciding the Best Option:
To determine the best tibial component option, consider the following factors:

- **Patient's Anatomy and Bone Quality**: Assess the patient's bone quality and anatomy to choose a component that provides adequate support and stability.
  
- **Type of Fracture**: The nature of the distal femur fracture (e.g., comminuted, simple) may influence the choice of tibial component.

- **Alignment and Stability**: Ensure that the tibial component aligns properly with the femoral component to maintain joint stability and function.

- **Trial Components**: Use trial components to assess fit, leg length, and joint stability before finalizing the choice of the tibial component.

- **Surgeon's Preference and Experience**: The surgeon's familiarity with specific systems and components can also guide the decision-making process.

By evaluating these factors, the surgical team can select the most appropriate tibial component for optimal patient outcomes.",1,"The respondent's answer lists different tibial components and does not match the model answer's options, leading to an incorrect answer regarding both the available choices and the decision-making factors."
22,"Based on the document titled Orthogenesis Limb Preservation System Surgical Techniques from DePuy, answer this question: If I can’t get diaphyseal fixation in the femur, what are the options?",Cement the implant.,"If diaphyseal fixation in the femur cannot be achieved, the following options can be considered:

1. **Use of Cemented Stems**: If diaphyseal fixation is not possible, consider using cemented stems to secure the implant. This involves applying bone cement to the femoral canal to enhance stability.

2. **Utilize Intercalary Components**: If the diaphysis cannot be adequately fixed, intercalary components can be used to bridge the gap and provide stability.

3. **Adjusting the Resection Level**: If fixation is inadequate, reevaluate the resection level and consider adjusting it to ensure that healthy bone is available for fixation.

4. **Soft Tissue Reconstruction**: Ensure that soft tissue coverage is adequate. If significant soft tissue has been resected, mobilizing remaining musculature may be necessary to achieve proper coverage around the prosthesis.

5. **Consider Alternative Fixation Techniques**: Depending on the specific situation, alternative fixation methods such as using plates or external fixators may be considered to provide additional stability.

6. **Evaluate the Use of Hinged Components**: In cases where traditional fixation methods are not viable, hinged components may provide the necessary stability and function.

These options should be evaluated based on the specific clinical scenario, the patient's anatomy, and the surgeon's experience and preference.",1,"The respondent provided many options beyond what the model answer specifies (cementing the implant), making the response incorrect."
23,"Based on the document titled Orthogenesis Limb Preservation System Surgical Techniques from DePuy, answer this question: When should a distal femoral replacement be used or considered?","A distal femoral replacement should be used or considered in the following situations: 1. **Severe Bone Loss**: When there is significant bone loss in the distal femur due to trauma, tumor resection, or infection that cannot be adequately addressed with other fixation methods. 2. **Non-Union or Malunion**: In cases where there is a non-union or malunion of the distal femur that cannot be corrected with traditional fixation techniques. 3. **Complex Fractures**: For complex fractures of the distal femur that involve significant comminution or instability, where standard fixation methods may not provide sufficient stability. 4. **Revision Surgery**: In revision surgeries where previous implants have failed, and there is a need for a more stable and robust solution. 5. **Tumor Resection**: Following the resection of tumors in the distal femur, where reconstruction is necessary to restore limb function and stability. 6. **Infection**: In cases of chronic infection that have led to bone loss or instability, a distal femoral replacement may be necessary to manage the condition effectively. In these scenarios, a distal femoral replacement can provide a stable and functional solution, allowing for improved mobility and quality of life for the patient.","A distal femoral replacement should be used or considered in the following situations:

1. **Severe Bone Loss**: When there is significant bone loss in the distal femur due to conditions such as tumors, infections, or trauma.

2. **Failed Previous Surgeries**: In cases where previous joint replacements or surgeries have failed, leading to instability or loss of function.

3. **Oncological Resection**: When performing a resection for bone tumors, especially if the tumor involves the distal femur and requires extensive removal of bone.

4. **Inadequate Soft Tissue Support**: If the surrounding soft tissues are compromised and cannot adequately support the joint, a distal femoral replacement may provide the necessary stability.

5. **Joint Instability**: When there is instability in the knee joint that cannot be corrected with less invasive measures.

6. **Patient's Functional Needs**: If the patient's functional demands require a more stable and durable solution than what can be provided by other methods.

In deciding whether to use a distal femoral replacement, factors such as the patient's overall health, activity level, and specific anatomical considerations should be taken into account. Preoperative imaging and careful planning are essential to ensure the best outcomes.",2,"The respondent's answer includes several of the correct indications (severe bone loss, failed previous surgeries, oncological resection) but omits key situations mentioned in the model answer (non-union/malunion, complex fractures, infection) and adds extra items not supported by the protocol."
24,"Based on the document titled Orthogenesis Limb Preservation System Surgical Techniques from DePuy, answer this question: What can I do with the distal femoral component if I can’t close the retinaculum?",Change your implant or shorten the construct.,"If you cannot close the retinaculum after placing the distal femoral component, consider the following options:

1. **Soft Tissue Reconstruction**: Ensure that the soft tissue closure completely covers the prosthesis. If significant soft tissue has been resected, mobilizing remaining musculature may be necessary to achieve proper coverage.

2. **Knee Brace**: If knee flexion beyond 90 degrees causes luxation of the hinged insert bearing out of the tibial component base, consider using a knee brace postoperatively to limit flexion to 90 degrees.

3. **Wound Closure in Full Extension**: In cases of inadequate soft tissue integrity, consider closing the wound with the knee in full extension to minimize tension on the closure.

4. **Evaluate for Extremity Shortening**: If there is significant soft tissue fibrosis or tension, extremity shortening may be necessary to allow for wound closure without undue tension.

5. **Use of Drains**: Close the wound over large bore drains to minimize hematoma collection, which can help in managing soft tissue integrity postoperatively.

These steps can help manage the situation effectively while ensuring the stability and integrity of the surgical construct.",2,"The respondent's answer only partially matches the model answer by suggesting extremity shortening, without addressing the implant change option."
25,"Based on the document titled Orthogenesis Limb Preservation System Surgical Techniques from DePuy, answer this question: If I have patellar impingement on the mechanism, what are my choices to modify the construct?","If there is patellar impingement on the mechanism in the DePuy Orthogenesis Limb Preservation System, the following choices can be considered to modify the construct: 1. **Adjust the Position of the Patellar Component**: Reassess and potentially reposition the patellar component to ensure it is aligned properly and not causing impingement. 2. **Modify the Femoral Component**: If the femoral component is contributing to the impingement, consider adjusting its position or orientation to alleviate the pressure on the patella. 3. **Increase the Patellar Thickness**: If feasible, using a thicker patellar component may help in reducing the impingement by providing better clearance. 4. **Perform a Lateral Release**: If the lateral structures are tight, a lateral release may help reduce tension and allow for better patellar tracking, thereby alleviating impingement. 5. **Evaluate Soft Tissue Tension**: Assess the surrounding soft tissues for any excessive tension that may be contributing to the impingement and make necessary adjustments. 6. **Consider a Different Patellar Design**: If the current design is not suitable, consider using a different patellar design that may provide better clearance and reduce the risk of impingement. 7. **Reassess the Overall Alignment**: Ensure that the overall alignment of the limb is correct, as malalignment can contribute to patellar impingement. These modifications aim to alleviate the impingement and improve the function of the knee joint while maintaining the stability of the construct.","If there is patellar impingement on the mechanism, the following modifications can be made to the tibial component:

1. **Resurface the Patella**: Consider resurfacing the patella using a dome patella replacement component, such as the S-ROM or Sigma dome patella component, to improve tracking and reduce impingement.

2. **Adjust the Tibial Component Position**: Ensure that the tibial component is properly aligned. Misalignment can contribute to patellar impingement, so adjustments may be necessary to achieve optimal positioning.

3. **Modify the Bumper Height**: If applicable, adjust the height of the bumper to provide better support and alignment for the patella, which can help alleviate impingement.

4. **Evaluate the Use of Different Insert Bearings**: Consider using different tibial insert bearings that may provide better patellar tracking and reduce the risk of impingement.

5. **Trial Constructs**: Use trial constructs to assess fit and alignment before finalizing the tibial component. This allows for adjustments based on the patient's anatomy and the specific mechanics of the knee.

6. **Check for Soft Tissue Integrity**: Assess the integrity of the surrounding soft tissues, as inadequate soft tissue support can contribute to patellar instability and impingement.

By implementing these modifications, you can help address patellar impingement and improve the overall function of the knee construct.",1,"The respondent's answer incorrectly focuses on modifying the tibial component, whereas the model answer emphasizes adjustments to the patellar and femoral components along with other considerations; thus, it does not align with the correct options described."

1. **Bumper Options**:
   - The bumper is typically part of the tibial component and can be adjusted or modified to improve patellar tracking and stability. Specific bumper options may include different heights or designs that can be selected based on the patient's anatomy and the surgical requirements.

2. **Polyethylene (Poly) Options**:
   - The tibial component may utilize various polyethylene inserts, which can vary in thickness and design. These inserts are designed to provide a bearing surface for the femoral component and can be selected based on the desired range of motion and stability.

### Choosing the Best Option:
To decide on the best bumper and poly options, consider the following factors:

- **Patient Anatomy**: Assess the patient's knee anatomy, including any deformities or previous surgeries that may affect alignment and stability.
  
- **Range of Motion**: Evaluate the desired range of motion for the patient and select a bumper and poly that facilitate this while maintaining stability.

- **Trial Components**: Use trial components during the procedure to assess fit and function before finalizing the choice of bumper and poly.

- **Soft Tissue Integrity**: Consider the integrity of the surrounding soft tissues, as this can influence the choice of components and their alignment.

By carefully evaluating these factors, you can select the most appropriate bumper and polyethylene options for the construct to optimize knee function and stability.",1,"The respondent's answer fails to provide the specific details required (namely ""no bumper"" and the exact poly sizes) and instead contains irrelevant or inaccurate information."
27,"Based on the document titled Orthogenesis Limb Preservation System Surgical Techniques from DePuy, answer this question: Is this a central femoral hinge or posterior consular hinge? Which has better quad efficiency and lower dislocation rate?",Posterior condylar hinge. The central femoral hinge has better quad efficiency and lower dislocation rate.,"The document does not explicitly state whether the system uses a central femoral hinge or a posterior condylar hinge. However, it does mention that the rotating knee hinge allows for hyperextension and flexion, which is characteristic of hinge designs.

In general, when comparing central femoral hinges and posterior condylar hinges:

- **Central Femoral Hinge**: Typically provides better quadriceps efficiency due to its design, which allows for more natural knee mechanics and better alignment with the quadriceps muscle.

- **Posterior Condylar Hinge**: May have a lower dislocation rate in certain cases due to its design that can provide more stability in the knee joint.

To decide which option is best, consider the following factors:

1. **Patient Anatomy**: Assess the patient's knee anatomy and any previous surgeries that may affect stability.

2. **Functional Requirements**: Evaluate the patient's activity level and functional needs, as this may influence the choice of hinge design.

3. **Surgeon's Experience**: The surgeon's familiarity with either hinge type can also guide the decision.

4. **Trial Components**: Use trial components to assess fit and function before finalizing the choice of hinge design.

Ultimately, the choice between a central femoral hinge and a posterior condylar hinge should be based on a comprehensive evaluation of the patient's specific needs and the surgical team's expertise.",1,The respondent fails to provide the correct information; they do not state that the system uses a posterior condylar hinge and that the central femoral hinge has better quadriceps efficiency and lower dislocation rate as required by the model answer.
28,"Based on the document titled Orthogenesis Limb Preservation System Surgical Techniques from DePuy, answer this question: Is there an all poly tibial baseplate option if I wanted to use it as a spacer?",No.,"The document does not explicitly mention an ""all poly tibial baseplate"" option for use as a spacer. However, it discusses the use of various tibial components, including the S-ROM hinged tibial insert bearing and the Orthogenesis LPS hinged tibial insert bearing, which can be utilized depending on the specific surgical situation.

If you are considering using a tibial component as a spacer, it is important to evaluate the specific design and material options available within the system. For detailed specifications and options, it may be necessary to refer to the LPS Design Guide or consult with the manufacturer for the most appropriate component to use as a spacer.",3,"The respondent correctly indicates that the document does not mention an all poly tibial baseplate option, aligning with the model answer ""No."""
