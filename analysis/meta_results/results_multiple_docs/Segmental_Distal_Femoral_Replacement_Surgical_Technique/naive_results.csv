   - **Polyethylene Tibial Bushing**: This is inserted into the tibial baseplate and is designed to accommodate the tibial component.

These components are crucial for ensuring proper articulation and function of the knee joint in the context of the distal femoral replacement.",1,The respondent provided incorrect details and did not match the model answer that specified “9mm to 24mm per rep. NO bumper.”
27,"Based on the document titled Segmental Distal Femoral Replacement Surgical Technique from Zimmer Biomet, answer this question: Is this a central femoral hinge or posterior consular hinge? Which has better quad efficiency and lower dislocation rate?",It uses a posterior condylar hinge. Central is better.,"The document does not explicitly specify whether the system uses a central femoral hinge or a posterior condylar hinge. However, in general orthopedic practice:

- **Central Femoral Hinge**: Typically provides better quadriceps efficiency due to its design, which allows for more natural knee mechanics and better alignment with the quadriceps muscle.

- **Posterior Condylar Hinge**: May have a lower dislocation rate in certain cases due to its design that can provide more stability in the knee joint.

To determine which option is best, consider the following factors:

1. **Patient Anatomy**: Assess the patient's knee anatomy and any previous surgeries that may affect stability.

2. **Functional Requirements**: Evaluate the patient's activity level and functional needs, as this may influence the choice of hinge design.

3. **Surgeon's Experience**: The surgeon's familiarity with either hinge type can also guide the decision.

4. **Trial Components**: Use trial components to assess fit and function before finalizing the choice of hinge design.

Ultimately, the choice between a central femoral hinge and a posterior condylar hinge should be based on a comprehensive evaluation of the patient's specific needs and the surgical team's expertise.",1,"The respondent failed to provide the model answer, instead stating that the document does not specify the hinge type and discussing general factors rather than indicating that it uses a posterior condylar hinge and that central hinges offer better quad efficiency."
28,"Based on the document titled Segmental Distal Femoral Replacement Surgical Technique from Zimmer Biomet, answer this question: Is there an all poly tibial baseplate option if I wanted to use it as a spacer?",No.,"The document does not explicitly mention an ""all poly tibial baseplate"" option for use as a spacer. However, it does indicate that polyethylene components, such as tibial bushings, are used in the tibial baseplate assembly.

If you are considering using a tibial component as a spacer, it is important to evaluate the specific design and material options available within the system. For detailed specifications and options, it may be necessary to refer to the product documentation or consult with Zimmer Biomet for the most appropriate component to use as a spacer.",3,"The respondent correctly concludes that the document does not provide an all poly tibial baseplate option for spacer use, aligning with the model answer while adding additional context."
