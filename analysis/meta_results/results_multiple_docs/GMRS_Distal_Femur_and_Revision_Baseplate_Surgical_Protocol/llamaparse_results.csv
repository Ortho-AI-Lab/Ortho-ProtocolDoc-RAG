1. **Evaluate Soft Tissue Tension**: Assess the soft tissue tension around the knee joint while the knee is in extension. This evaluation helps determine if excessive tension is preventing closure.

2. **Check Component Alignment**: Ensure that the tibial and femoral components are properly aligned. Misalignment can lead to tension on the retinaculum, making closure difficult.

3. **Use of Sutures**: If possible, use sutures to reattach any available soft tissue structures to the appropriate anatomical locations, which can help provide additional support and stability.

4. **Close with Knee in Extension**: If soft tissue integrity is compromised, consider closing the wound with the knee in full extension to minimize tension on the retinaculum.

5. **Postoperative Care**: Implement a postoperative care plan that includes monitoring for complications and ensuring that the knee is stabilized appropriately.
