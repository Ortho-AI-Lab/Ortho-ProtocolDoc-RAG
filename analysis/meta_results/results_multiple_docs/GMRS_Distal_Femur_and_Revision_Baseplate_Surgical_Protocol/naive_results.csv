In these scenarios, a distal femoral replacement can provide a stable and functional solution, allowing for improved mobility and quality of life for the patient.","If the knee does not fully extend, the following steps should be evaluated to change the construct:

1. **Assess Soft Tissue Tension**: Place the knee in extension and evaluate the soft tissue tension. This assessment is crucial to determine if the tension is contributing to the lack of full extension.

2. **Select Appropriate Tibial Bearing**: Choose a tibial bearing that allows for full extension but does not exceed 8 mm of joint distraction when longitudinal traction is applied in full extension.

3. **Trial Components**: Use trial components to ensure proper fit and interaction of all components. This includes inserting the trial axle through the condyles to fully capture the construct.

4. **Hyperflex the Knee**: In some cases, hyperflexing the knee with the patella everted may help articulate the tibial and femoral components properly.

5. **Adjust Component Heights**: If necessary, adjust the heights of the tibial bearing or femoral component to improve alignment and function.

6. **Final Assessment**: After making adjustments, re-evaluate the knee's range of motion and stability to ensure that the changes have resolved the extension issue.
