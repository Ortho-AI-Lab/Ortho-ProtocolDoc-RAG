Question Num,Question,Correct Answer,Answer,Score,Rationale
1,"Based on the document titled GMRS Distal Femur and Revision Baseplate Surgical Protocol from Stryker, answer this question: How long is the distal femoral component?",65mm,"It depends on size:
- Small: 45 mm A/P (52 mm M/L)
- Standard: 54 mm A/P (60 mm M/L)",1,The respondent's answer does not match the required specification of 65mm and introduces additional varying sizes that are incorrect.
2,"Based on the document titled GMRS Distal Femur and Revision Baseplate Surgical Protocol from Stryker, answer this question: Is there a press fit or cementless option?",Yes,"Yes. The protocol includes a Revision Baseplate with Fluted Stem option, where cement is applied to the tibial surface only (no retrograde canal fill), indicating a press-fit/cementless stem. There is also a fully cemented stem option.",3,"The respondent clearly confirms that a press fit/cementless option is available, and even provides accurate additional context from the protocol."
3,"Based on the document titled GMRS Distal Femur and Revision Baseplate Surgical Protocol from Stryker, answer this question: How do you check rotation?",Should be aligned with linea aspera.,"Use a straight edge (e.g., the Distal Femoral Template) to mark the anterior cortex above the resection level in line with the trochlear groove (directly anterior to the linea aspera). During trialing/implantation, align the stem’s rotational marking with this cortical mark to confirm rotation.",3,"The respondent's answer correctly details the method by explaining that the rotational check is done using a cortical mark aligned with the lateral anatomy, corresponding to the alignment with the linea aspera."
4,"Based on the document titled GMRS Distal Femur and Revision Baseplate Surgical Protocol from Stryker, answer this question: What is the shortest construct I can use?",76mm without body and 105mm with body,The shortest construct is the Distal Femoral Component attached directly to a cemented stem with no extension piece—use the stem without the extra‑cortical porous‑coated body section (11 mm replacement length).,1,"The respondent's answer does not provide the correct numeric values (76mm without body and 105mm with body) and instead gives an irrelevant description and an incorrect measurement, making it incorrect."
5,"Based on the document titled GMRS Distal Femur and Revision Baseplate Surgical Protocol from Stryker, answer this question: What degree do I cut the tibia in?",Zero degrees,"0° posterior slope (neutral), i.e., perpendicular to the tibial mechanical axis.",3,"The respondent correctly indicates that the tibia should be cut at zero degrees, matching the model answer, and provides additional clarification without error."
6,"Based on the document titled GMRS Distal Femur and Revision Baseplate Surgical Protocol from Stryker, answer this question: What are the poly sizes?","11, 13, 16, 19, 22 mm",The provided protocol content does not specify the polyethylene (poly) sizes. I can’t determine them from this excerpt.,1,"The respondent incorrectly states that the protocol doesn't specify the poly sizes, whereas the correct answer is 11, 13, 16, 19, 22 mm."
7,"Based on the document titled GMRS Distal Femur and Revision Baseplate Surgical Protocol from Stryker, answer this question: What is the minimum stem diameter?",8mm,8 mm,3,The respondent's answer matches the correct answer exactly.
8,"Based on the document titled GMRS Distal Femur and Revision Baseplate Surgical Protocol from Stryker, answer this question: What are the body segment lengths?","There is only one body segment length of 40mm that is extra-cortical. However, there are multiple extension pieces lengths in 10mm increments to achieve a construct as long as 325mm. This is all found in page 49.",40 mm for the extra-cortical porous-coated body section and 11 mm for the non-coated version.,2,The response correctly identifies the 40 mm extra‐cortical length but erroneously includes an 11 mm non‐coated version and omits the extension pieces in 10 mm increments.
9,"Based on the document titled GMRS Distal Femur and Revision Baseplate Surgical Protocol from Stryker, answer this question: What is the maximum stem diameter?",17mm is the largest stem diameter for either curved or straight.,17 mm,3,The respondent correctly provided the maximum stem diameter as stated in the model answer.
10,"Based on the document titled GMRS Distal Femur and Revision Baseplate Surgical Protocol from Stryker, answer this question: What are cone sizes?","Symmetric and asymmetric. Each come in sizes A, B, C, D, and E.","A, B, C, D, and E.",2,The respondent provided the size letters but omitted the critical detail that these sizes apply to both symmetric and asymmetric cone types.
11,"Based on the document titled GMRS Distal Femur and Revision Baseplate Surgical Protocol from Stryker, answer this question: What are the augment sizes on the tibia?",Augments come in 5mm and 10mm increments for each tibial size.,Sizes 1 through 8 (with 5 mm and 10 mm thickness options).,3,"The respondent correctly indicates that the tibial augments come with 5 mm and 10 mm thickness options, matching the model answer, even though they also mentioned sizes 1 through 8 which does not detract from the correctness."
12,"Based on the document titled GMRS Distal Femur and Revision Baseplate Surgical Protocol from Stryker, answer this question: What’s the minimum total distal femur resection?",The minimum resection length is 76mm,The protocol does not specify a minimum total distal femur resection.,1,The respondent's answer disregards the fact that the minimum resection is clearly specified as 76mm.
13,"Based on the document titled GMRS Distal Femur and Revision Baseplate Surgical Protocol from Stryker, answer this question: Is there a non-nickel containing option?",There is not.,The protocol does not specify a non‑nickel containing option.,3,The respondent's answer correctly indicates that the protocol does not specify a non‑nickel containing option.
14,"Based on the document titled GMRS Distal Femur and Revision Baseplate Surgical Protocol from Stryker, answer this question: What is the tibial boss length and diameter?",56mm long and 15mm wide,"- Tibial boss diameter: 19 mm
- Tibial boss length: Not specified in the protocol (set by the boss reamer’s physical stop)",1,"The respondent's answer is incorrect on both counts, providing the wrong diameter (19 mm instead of 15 mm) and inaccurately stating that the tibial boss length is not specified rather than the correct 56 mm."
15,"Based on the document titled GMRS Distal Femur and Revision Baseplate Surgical Protocol from Stryker, answer this question: What is the minimum reamer I have to use on the femur and tibia?",The minimum reamer is 10mm.,"- Femur: Ream 2 mm larger than the selected stem. For the smallest 8 mm stem, the minimum flexible reamer is 10 mm.
- Tibia: Ream to achieve the desired stem diameter and cement mantle. If using a stem extender, it is 16 mm in diameter, so ream accordingly.",2,The respondent correctly identifies the 10mm minimum reamer for the femur but does not provide the same minimum for the tibia as indicated in the model answer.
16,"Based on the document titled GMRS Distal Femur and Revision Baseplate Surgical Protocol from Stryker, answer this question: Is there a distal femur resection guide for measurement?","Yes, there is a distal femur resection guide available for measurement in the Stryker Triathlon TS Femur and Revision Baseplate.","Yes. The protocol specifies a Distal Femoral Template used to measure and mark the distal femur resection level, guiding the resection to reproducible implant levels.",3,"The respondent accurately describes the measurement guide by identifying it as a Distal Femoral Template, which meets the protocol’s description of guiding the distal femur resection level."
17,"Based on the document titled GMRS Distal Femur and Revision Baseplate Surgical Protocol from Stryker, answer this question: What is the valgus angle of the distal femoral cut?",The valgus angle of the distal femoral cut in the Stryker Triathlon TS Femur and Revision Baseplate is 6 degrees.,0° valgus (the cut is perpendicular to the femoral shaft).,1,The respondent's answer is incorrect as it does not match the correct value of 6 degrees.
18,"Based on the document titled GMRS Distal Femur and Revision Baseplate Surgical Protocol from Stryker, answer this question: If the knee does not fully extend, what are the steps we evaluate to change the construct?",Cut more distal femur or shorten the construct.,"- Bring the knee to full extension and palpate femoral pulses. If pulses are diminished in extension and improve with flexion, the construct is too long/tight and needs to be shortened.
- Recheck the tibial–femoral leg-length reference marks.
- Compare the distal femoral resection length to the assembled prosthesis length.
- If too long/tight, modify the construct by:
  - Removing additional distal femoral bone, or
  - Shortening/adjusting the prosthesis length, or
  - Using a thinner insert (shift the Hinge Trial Bearing Plate to a thinner slot); adjust the Trial Bumper angle as needed.
- If shortening the femur/construct would compromise patellar tracking, remove additional bone from the tibial side instead.
- Reassess to ensure full extension, proper patellar tracking, and acceptable distal pulses before accepting final length.",3,The respondent's answer includes the key steps—removing additional distal femoral bone or shortening the construct—while adding extra detail that aligns with the document.
19,"Based on the document titled GMRS Distal Femur and Revision Baseplate Surgical Protocol from Stryker, answer this question: If the knee is too recurvatum in flexion and extension, what are the steps we evaluate to change the construct? What can we do with the bumper in this scenario?",Lengthen the construct.,"- Evaluate and adjust insert thickness: with the knee at 90°, shift the Hinge Trial Bearing Plate to the next slot (thicker insert) and then check the extension gap at 0°. Repeat trial reduction as needed.
- Adjust the bumper: change the Trial Bumper angle as required; in this setting, select the 3° flexion bumper (instead of neutral) to bias the knee into flexion and reduce recurvatum.",2,"The respondent’s answer describes adjusting insert thickness (using a thicker insert) and modifying the bumper angle, which can be interpreted as an attempt to lengthen the construct. However, the answer is more detailed and deviates from the model’s simple “lengthen the construct” response, making it partially correct/incomplete."
20,"Based on the document titled GMRS Distal Femur and Revision Baseplate Surgical Protocol from Stryker, answer this question: If the patella is laterally dislocating, what can be done to modify the tibia?",Externally rotate the tibia or consider externally rotating the femoral component.,Medialize the tibial tubercle (tibial tubercle osteotomy/transfer) to improve patellar tracking and prevent lateral dislocation.,1,The respondent's answer does not match the protocol's recommendation of externally rotating the tibia or femoral component and instead suggests a different technique.
21,"Based on the document titled GMRS Distal Femur and Revision Baseplate Surgical Protocol from Stryker, answer this question: What are the choices for the tibial component in the setting of a distal femur fracture? How do I decide which is the best option?",The revision baseplate or MRH baseplate.,"Choices
- GMRS Revision Tibial Baseplate (offsetting not possible), paired with:
  - Tibial Sleeve
  - Tibial Augments (5 mm or 10 mm, attached under the baseplate)
  - Compatible Tibial Bearing Component and Tibial Insert

How to decide
- Size and position with the Universal Tibial Template; attach the Tibial Alignment Handle for sizing.
- If you made augment cuts, attach Tibial Augment Trials to the underside of the template to confirm need for 5 mm or 10 mm augments.
- Verify rotation and alignment using the Revision Keel Punch Guide and Universal Alignment Rod.
- Because offsetting is not available with the Revision baseplate, choose the baseplate size and position that achieve coverage and alignment without offset.",1,The respondent's answer is not aligned with the model answer. It lists additional details and accessories for the revision baseplate but omits the choice of using a revision (or MRH) baseplate as the sole option and does not match the concise response provided in the model answer.
22,"Based on the document titled GMRS Distal Femur and Revision Baseplate Surgical Protocol from Stryker, answer this question: If I can’t get diaphyseal fixation in the femur, what are the options?",Cement the femoral component.,"- Cement the femoral stem (use a cement restrictor and rely on metaphyseal/cement fixation rather than press-fit diaphyseal purchase).
- Use an allograft-prosthetic composite to restore length and allow stem fixation.
- If adequate fixation still isn’t achievable, convert to a total femur replacement.",2,The respondent provided the correct option but also included extra alternatives not supported by the surgical protocol.
23,"Based on the document titled GMRS Distal Femur and Revision Baseplate Surgical Protocol from Stryker, answer this question: When should a distal femoral replacement be used or considered?","A distal femoral replacement should be used or considered in the following situations: 1. **Severe Bone Loss**: When there is significant bone loss in the distal femur due to trauma, tumor resection, or infection that cannot be adequately addressed with other fixation methods. 2. **Non-Union or Malunion**: In cases where there is a non-union or malunion of the distal femur that cannot be corrected with traditional fixation techniques. 3. **Complex Fractures**: For complex fractures of the distal femur that involve significant comminution or instability, where standard fixation methods may not provide sufficient stability. 4. **Revision Surgery**: In revision surgeries where previous implants have failed, and there is a need for a more stable and robust solution. 5. **Tumor Resection**: Following the resection of tumors in the distal femur, where reconstruction is necessary to restore limb function and stability. 6. **Infection**: In cases of chronic infection that have led to bone loss or instability, a distal femoral replacement may be necessary to manage the condition effectively. In these scenarios, a distal femoral replacement can provide a stable and functional solution, allowing for improved mobility and quality of life for the patient.","Consider a distal femoral replacement when there is extensive distal femoral bone loss or pathology that cannot be reliably reconstructed with standard arthroplasty techniques (stems, augments, cones), including:
- Oncologic indications: limb-sparing reconstruction after resection of primary bone tumors or metastatic disease/pathologic fracture of the distal femur.
- Failed total knee arthroplasty with massive distal femoral bone loss and/or collateral ligament insufficiency requiring a linked/hinged construct.
- Periprosthetic or native distal femur fractures that are unreconstructable (severely comminuted, osteoporotic, poor bone stock), especially in low-demand or elderly patients.
- Salvage after multiple revisions or infection with segmental bone loss where stable fixation of conventional components is not feasible.
- Acute traumatic distal femur destruction that is not reconstructable, as a limb-salvage alternative to above-knee amputation.",3,"The respondent provided a comprehensive answer that includes extensive distal femoral bone loss, oncologic indications, revision cases, unreconstructable fractures, and infection cases, which directly aligns with the model answer's rationale."
24,"Based on the document titled GMRS Distal Femur and Revision Baseplate Surgical Protocol from Stryker, answer this question: What can I do with the distal femoral component if I can’t close the retinaculum?","Shorten the construct, rotate the component, or remove the patella.","Slightly externally rotate the distal femoral component to improve patellar tracking, which can facilitate retinacular (capsular) closure.",2,The respondent correctly identifies that rotating the component is an option but omits the additional alternatives of shortening the construct or removing the patella.
25,"Based on the document titled GMRS Distal Femur and Revision Baseplate Surgical Protocol from Stryker, answer this question: If I have patellar impingement on the mechanism, what are my choices to modify the construct?","Shorten the construct, rotate the component, or remove the patella.","Options to modify the construct for patellar impingement on the mechanism:

- Switch the bumper: use the 3° flexion bumper instead of neutral to slightly flex the knee in extension and improve clearance.
- Adjust femoral component rotation: slight external rotation may aid patellar tracking.
- Modify construct length/joint line:
  - Change insert thickness by moving to a different bearing plate slot (thinner if the construct is too long).
  - If still too long, shorten the construct by removing additional bone or adjusting prosthesis length; if femoral shortening worsens tracking, remove bone from the tibial side.",2,"The respondent correctly mentioned rotating the component and shortening the construct, but did not include the option to remove the patella, resulting in a partially complete answer."
26,"Based on the document titled GMRS Distal Femur and Revision Baseplate Surgical Protocol from Stryker, answer this question: What are the bumper and poly options in my construct?","Neutral or 3 degree bumper. 11, 13, 16, 19, 22 mm poly.","- Bumper options: Neutral (6481-2-130) or 3° flexion (6481-2-133). Trial bumpers: 6543-6-101/103.
- Poly (tibial insert) options: Use the Triathlon Hinge Tibial Bearing Component, Size 1–2 (5612-0-001). Insert size must match the baseplate size, and thickness is selected based on the Trial Bearing Plate slots. The hinge insert is only used with the cemented Revision Baseplate.",2,"The respondent correctly identifies the bumper options (Neutral and 3° flexion) but does not provide the correct poly options (i.e., the 11, 13, 16, 19, 22 mm sizes) as required."
27,"Based on the document titled GMRS Distal Femur and Revision Baseplate Surgical Protocol from Stryker, answer this question: Is this a central femoral hinge or posterior consular hinge? Which has better quad efficiency and lower dislocation rate?","The Stryker Triathlon TS Femur and Revision Baseplate utilizes a **central femoral hinge** design. This design is known to provide better quadriceps efficiency and a lower dislocation rate compared to a posterior condylar hinge. The central femoral hinge allows for more natural knee mechanics, contributing to improved function and stability.",Posterior condylar hinge. Posterior condylar designs generally provide better quadriceps efficiency and a lower dislocation rate than central femoral hinges.,1,The answer is incorrect as it misidentifies the hinge type and contradicts the known benefits stated in the protocol.
28,"Based on the document titled GMRS Distal Femur and Revision Baseplate Surgical Protocol from Stryker, answer this question: Is there an all poly tibial baseplate option if I wanted to use it as a spacer?","Yes, there is an all-poly tibial baseplate option available in the Stryker Triathlon TS Femur and Revision Baseplate that can be used as a spacer. This option is designed to provide stability and support while allowing for flexibility in surgical planning.",No. The system uses the Triathlon Revision Tibial Baseplate; there is no all‑poly tibial baseplate option described for use as a spacer.,1,"The respondent incorrectly states that there is no all‑poly option, directly contradicting the correct protocol information."
