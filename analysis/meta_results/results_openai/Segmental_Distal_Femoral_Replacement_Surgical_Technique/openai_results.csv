21,"Based on the document titled Segmental Distal Femoral Replacement Surgical Technique from Zimmer Biomet, answer this question: What are the choices for the tibial component in the setting of a distal femur fracture? How do I decide which is the best option?","In the setting of a distal femur fracture, the choices for the tibial component in the Zimmer Biomet Segmental Distal Femoral Replacement Surgical Technique include: 1. **Standard Tibial Component**: This is typically used for most cases and provides a stable foundation for the limb. 2. **Augmented Tibial Component**: This option is used when there is significant bone loss or deformity that requires additional support. 3. **Cemented Tibial Component**: This may be chosen for patients with poor bone quality or when additional fixation is needed. To decide which is the best option, consider the following factors: - **Bone Quality**: Assess the quality and quantity of the bone in the tibia. Poor bone quality may necessitate a cemented option or an augmented component. - **Extent of the Fracture**: Evaluate the severity and location of the distal femur fracture. If there is significant displacement or instability, an augmented component may provide better support. - **Patient Factors**: Consider the patient's age, activity level, and overall health. Younger, more active patients may benefit from a standard component, while older patients with lower activity levels may require a more stable option. - **Surgeon's Preference and Experience**: The surgeon's familiarity with the components and their outcomes can also influence the choice. By evaluating these factors, the most appropriate tibial component can be selected to optimize the surgical outcome.","Choices
- A: Short non‑modular tibial component
- B: Modular tibial baseplate without a stem
- C: Long non‑modular tibial component
- D: Modular tibial baseplate with a stem

How to decide
- Size/coverage and rotation: Select the option (using the tibial sled) that provides the best tibial plateau coverage without overhang and establishes appropriate external rotation.
- Need for a stem: Use a modular baseplate with a stem (D) when you want diaphyseal fixation; use a modular baseplate without a stem (B) or a non‑modular option (A/C) when stem fixation isn’t needed.
- Short vs long: Choose short (A) vs long (C) based on tibial size and required footprint for stable coverage.
- Note: The modular tibial baseplate has a larger distal diameter to accommodate the stem taper, which affects sizing.
