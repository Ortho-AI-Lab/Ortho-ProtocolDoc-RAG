QUESTION-ANSWER PAIR 2

QUESTION:
Based on the Onkos Surgical reference document, answer this: Is there a press fit or cementless option?

ANSWER:
Yes, there is a cementless option available in the Onkos Surgical system. The Onkos Surgical Patient Specific Devices are indicated for both cemented and cementless procedures, particularly for radical resection and replacement of the distal femur.

### Key Points:
- **Cementless Procedures**: The implants can be used in a cementless manner, which is suitable for certain surgical scenarios.
- **Cemented Procedures**: The system also supports cemented applications, where care must be taken to ensure that cement does not adhere to the hydroxyapatite (HA) coated collar to promote proper bony ingrowth.

This flexibility allows surgeons to choose the most appropriate fixation method based on the specific needs of the patient and the surgical context.

QUESTION:
Based on the Onkos Surgical reference document, answer this: How do you check rotation?

ANSWER:
To check rotation during the procedure with Onkos Surgical implants, follow these steps:

1. **Position the Knee**: 
   - Place the knee in extension. This position allows for a clear assessment of the alignment and rotation of the components.

2. **Evaluate Soft Tissue Tension**: 
   - While the knee is in extension, assess the soft tissue tension around the joint. Proper tension is crucial for maintaining stability and alignment.

3. **Use Reference Points**: 
   - Mark reference points on the femur and tibia to help assess the rotational alignment. This can include marking the anterior surface of the femur and the corresponding points on the tibia.

4. **Trial Components**: 
   - Use trial components to assess the fit and alignment. This allows for adjustments to be made before finalizing the implant placement.

5. **Adjust as Necessary**: 
   - If the rotation is not correct, adjustments can be made by repositioning the components or using different sizes or configurations of the implants.

6. **Final Assessment**: 
   - After making any adjustments, perform a final assessment of the rotation and alignment before proceeding with the closure of the surgical site.

QUESTION:
Based on the Onkos Surgical reference document, answer this: If the knee is too loose in flexion and extension, what are the steps we evaluate to change the construct?

ANSWER:
If the knee is too loose in flexion and extension, the following steps should be evaluated to change the construct:

1. **Evaluate Soft Tissue Tension**: 
   - Place the knee in extension and assess the soft tissue tension around the joint. This evaluation helps determine if the looseness is due to inadequate tension in the surrounding soft tissues.

2. **Hyperflex the Knee**: 
   - Hyperflex the knee with the patella everted to articulate the tibial and femoral components. This can help in assessing the fit and alignment of the components.

3. **Check Component Alignment**: 
   - Ensure that the tibial and femoral components are properly aligned. Misalignment can contribute to instability.

4. **Adjust Component Size**: 
   - If the components are too large or not fitting properly, consider using different sizes or configurations of the implants to achieve a better fit.

5. **Reattach Soft Tissues**: 
   - If necessary, reattach the vastus lateralis and other relevant soft tissues to improve stability and alignment of the knee.

6. **Consider a Knee Brace**: 
   - If there is grossly inadequate soft-tissue integrity, consider using a knee brace postoperatively to limit flexion and provide additional support.

7. **Final Assessment**: 
   - After making adjustments, perform a final assessment of the knee's stability in both flexion and extension before proceeding with closure.

By following these steps, adjustments can be made to improve the stability of the knee construct and address any looseness in flexion and extension.

   - Place the knee in extension and assess the soft tissue tension around the joint. This evaluation helps determine if the tightness is due to excessive tension in the surrounding soft tissues.

2. **Hyperflex the Knee**: 
   - Hyperflex the knee with the patella everted to articulate the tibial and femoral components. This can help in assessing the fit and alignment of the components.

3. **Check Component Alignment**: 
   - Ensure that the tibial and femoral components are properly aligned. Misalignment can contribute to tightness.

4. **Adjust Component Size**: 
   - If the components are too large or not fitting properly, consider using different sizes or configurations of the implants to achieve a better fit.

5. **Reattach Soft Tissues**: 
   - If necessary, reattach the vastus lateralis and other relevant soft tissues to improve stability and alignment of the knee.

6. **Consider Reducing Leg Length**: 
   - If the leg length is slightly long, consider reducing the vertical height/leg length by adjusting the segmental trials.

7. **Final Assessment**: 
   - After making adjustments, perform a final assessment of the knee's stability in both flexion and extension before proceeding with closure.

By following these steps, adjustments can be made to alleviate tightness in the knee construct.

QUESTION-ANSWER PAIR 20

QUESTION:
Based on the Onkos Surgical reference document, answer this: If the patella is laterally dislocating, what can be done to modify this?

ANSWER:
If the patella is laterally dislocating, the following modifications can be considered based on the Onkos Surgical reference document:

1. **Evaluate Component Alignment**: 
   - Ensure that the femoral and tibial components are properly aligned. Misalignment can contribute to patellar instability.

2. **Adjust Femoral Component Position**: 
   - If the femoral component is positioned too laterally, it may contribute to lateral dislocation. Adjusting the position of the femoral component may help in realigning the patella.

3. **Use a Medialized Patellar Component**: 
   - Consider using a patellar component that is designed to be more medialized. This can help improve the tracking of the patella and reduce the tendency for lateral dislocation.

4. **Resurface the Patella**: 
   - Resurface the patella using a dome patella replacement component, such as the S-ROM or Sigma dome patella component. This can provide a better surface for patellar tracking.

5. **Reattach Soft Tissues**: 
   - If necessary, reattach the vastus lateralis and other relevant soft tissues to improve stability and alignment of the patella.

6. **Check for Adequate Soft Tissue Integrity**: 
   - Ensure that the soft tissue integrity around the knee is adequate. If there is grossly inadequate soft tissue support, consider using a knee brace postoperatively to limit flexion and provide additional support.

7. **Final Assessment**: 
   - After making adjustments, perform a final assessment of the patellar tracking and stability before proceeding with closure.

By following these steps, modifications can be made to help stabilize the patella and prevent lateral dislocation.
