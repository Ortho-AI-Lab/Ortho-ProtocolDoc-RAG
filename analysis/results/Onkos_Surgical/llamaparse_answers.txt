QUESTION-ANSWER PAIR 2

QUESTION:
Based on the Onkos Surgical reference document, answer this: Is there a press fit or cementless option?

ANSWER:
Yes, there is a press fit or cementless option available with Onkos Surgical implants. The implants are indicated for both cemented and cementless procedures, allowing for flexibility based on the specific clinical scenario.

### Key Points:
- **Cemented Procedures**: Commonly used in oncology cases, where a circumferential cement mantle is applied around the stem.
- **Cementless (Press Fit) Procedures**: When using a porous-coated straight stem extension, it is recommended to under-ream by 0.5 mm for a proper press-fit application. However, caution is advised in patients with marked osteopenia or those at risk for intraoperative fractures.

These options provide surgeons with the ability to choose the most appropriate fixation method based on the patient's condition and the specific requirements of the surgical procedure.

QUESTION-ANSWER PAIR 3

QUESTION:
Based on the Onkos Surgical reference document, answer this: How do you check rotation?

ANSWER:
To check rotation during the surgical procedure with Onkos Surgical implants, the following steps can be taken:

1. **Use of Reference Marks**: Mark the anterior cortex of the distal femur above the resection level in line with the trochlear groove. This mark serves as a reference for proper rotational alignment of the prosthetic components.

2. **Trial Assembly**: Hold the trial femoral assembly in one hand to prevent rotation. Extend the leg fully and assess the alignment of the trial components with the reference marks.

3. **Manipulate the Knee**: Move the knee through its range of motion to evaluate the alignment and ensure that the rotation is appropriate. If the evaluation identifies a rotation different from the marked position, make an additional mark or note the rotation relative to the existing mark.

4. **Adjust as Necessary**: If the rotation is not correct, adjust the alignment of the femoral component accordingly. Slight external rotation may aid in improving patellar tracking.

5. **Final Assessment**: After making adjustments, perform a final assessment of the knee's range of motion to ensure that the alignment is correct and that the patella tracks properly.

These steps are crucial for ensuring that the rotational alignment of the femoral component is accurate, which is essential for optimal knee function postoperatively.

QUESTION-ANSWER PAIR 18

QUESTION:
Based on the Onkos Surgical reference document, answer this: If the knee is too loose in flexion and extension, what are the steps we evaluate to change the construct?

ANSWER:
If the knee is too loose in flexion and extension, the following steps should be evaluated to change the construct:

1. **Assess Soft Tissue Integrity**: Evaluate the integrity of the soft tissues around the knee. If there is inadequate soft tissue support, this may contribute to the looseness.

2. **Check Alignment and Tension**: Place the knee in extension and evaluate the soft tissue tension. This can help determine if the components are properly aligned and if the soft tissues are contributing to instability.

3. **Reassess Leg Length**: Measure the leg length using reference marks on the tibia and femur. If the leg length is too long, it may lead to instability.

4. **Adjust Component Length**: If the prosthetic construct is too long, consider:
   - Removing additional bone from the femur.
   - Adjusting the length of the prosthesis.
   - Evaluating the use of a thinner insert.

5. **Evaluate Femoral Offset**: If the femoral offset is inadequate, consider using a longer femoral head to improve stability.

6. **Final Range of Motion Test**: Perform a final test of the knee's range of motion with the patella in place to ensure that the adjustments have improved stability.

7. **Postoperative Care**: If necessary, implement a postoperative care plan that may include bracing or physical therapy to further support the knee and improve stability.

These steps are crucial for ensuring that the knee construct is stable and functions properly postoperatively.



---------------------------------------------------



QUESTION-ANSWER PAIR 19

QUESTION:
Based on the Onkos Surgical reference document, answer this: If the knee is too tight in flexion and extension, what are the steps we evaluate to change the construct?

ANSWER:
If the knee is too tight in flexion and extension, the following steps should be evaluated to change the construct:

1. **Assess Soft Tissue Tension**: Evaluate the tension in the soft tissues around the knee. If the soft tissues are too tight, this may contribute to the restriction in motion.

2. **Check Leg Length**: Measure the leg length using reference marks on the tibia and femur. If the leg length is long, it may lead to excessive tension in the soft tissues.

3. **Adjust Component Length**: If the leg length is long and the soft tissues are tight, consider:
   - Using a shorter trial femoral head to reduce tension.
   - Adjusting the vertical height or leg length by modifying the segmental trials.

4. **Reassess Resection Levels**: If the segmental trials are at the minimum length and the leg length is still long, consider recutting the femoral osteotomy to adjust for the leg length discrepancy.

5. **Re-ream the Femur**: If the femoral cut is revised, re-ream the femur distally and finish the osteotomized surface with a calcar planer/bevel reamer to ensure proper fit and avoid intraoperative fractures.

6. **Final Range of Motion Test**: Perform a final test of the knee's range of motion with the patella in place to ensure that the adjustments have improved flexibility.

7. **Postoperative Care**: Implement a postoperative care plan that may include bracing or physical therapy to further support the knee and improve motion.

These steps are essential for ensuring that the knee construct is appropriately adjusted for optimal function and comfort postoperatively.

QUESTION-ANSWER PAIR 20

QUESTION:
Based on the Onkos Surgical reference document, answer this: If the patella is laterally dislocating, what can be done to modify this?

ANSWER:
If the patella is laterally dislocating, the following modifications can be considered based on the Onkos Surgical reference document:

1. **Reattach Soft Tissues**: Ensure that the vastus lateralis and other relevant soft tissues are properly reattached. This can provide additional support to the patella and help maintain its alignment.

2. **Evaluate and Adjust Component Alignment**: Check the alignment of the femoral component. Proper rotational alignment is crucial for patellar tracking. If necessary, adjust the alignment to improve the position of the patella.

3. **Use of a Thicker Insert**: If patellar tracking remains inadequate, consider using a thicker polyethylene insert to help stabilize the patella.

4. **Suture the Iliopsoas Muscle**: If appropriate, suture the iliopsoas muscle to the medial aspect of the proximal femoral body replacement component to enhance stability.

5. **Final Range of Motion Test**: After making adjustments, perform a final test of the knee's range of motion with the patella in place to ensure that the modifications have improved stability and tracking.

6. **Postoperative Care**: Implement a postoperative care plan that may include bracing or physical therapy to further support the knee and improve patellar tracking.

These steps are essential for addressing lateral dislocation of the patella and ensuring proper function of the knee construct.
