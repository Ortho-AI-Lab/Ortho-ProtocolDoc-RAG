QUESTION-ANSWER PAIR 2

QUESTION:
Is there a press fit or cementless option?

ANSWER:
Yes, there is a cementless option available for the distal femoral component. The press-fit stem can be used without cement, allowing for bony ingrowth. This method is typically employed with specific tibial trays, such as the S-ROM tibial tray, where only the cut tibia surface is cemented, while the stem itself is press-fit into the femur. 

Additionally, care should be taken to ensure that no cement adheres to any HA (hydroxyapatite) coated collars, as this could hinder proper bony ingrowth.

QUESTION-ANSWER PAIR 3

QUESTION:
How do you check rotation?

ANSWER:
To check the rotation of the distal femoral component during surgery, follow these steps:

1. **Use Trial Components**: Assemble the trial components and insert them into the femur. The trial components are designed to snap together and should match the dimensions of the final implant.

2. **Evaluate Orientation**: Assess the proper rotational orientation of the trial components. This can be done by comparing the knee joint line to the opposite side to ensure proper height and alignment.

3. **Marking for Alignment**: Once the correct orientation is established, use the anti-rotation slot (tab) on the trial component to mark the femur. This mark will serve as a reference for alignment when inserting the final implant.

4. **Check Fit and Stability**: Ensure that the trial stem closely matches the last intramedullary (IM) reamer used. The trial should be inserted by hand without impacting it into the canal to prevent any unwanted rotation or movement.

5. **Final Adjustments**: If necessary, adjust the femoral cut or re-ream the femur to ensure proper fit and alignment. This may involve checking the soft tissue tension and range of motion to confirm that the component is correctly positioned.

By following these steps, you can effectively check and ensure the proper rotation of the distal femoral component before finalizing the implantation.

QUESTION:
Is there a distal femur resection guide for measurement?

ANSWER:
Yes, there is a distal femur resection guide available for measurement. The **Distal Femoral Template** is designed to assist in guiding the resection to a level that can be reproduced by the available implants. Here are the key points regarding its use:

1. **Placement**: The template is placed on the bone so that its silhouette coincides with the distal condyles of the femur.

2. **Marking the Resection Level**: The anterior cortex of the femur is marked with a device (such as a bovie) to indicate the resection level. This marking helps ensure that the resection is performed accurately.

3. **Measurement**: The template includes engravings that correspond to the appropriate resection lengths based on the type of stem being used (with or without extra-cortical porous-coated body section).

4. **Reference for Leg Length**: A reference measurement can be established across the joint by marking points on both the femur and tibia before making the resection. This allows for checking the leg length after the resection is made.

5. **Importance of Alignment**: Proper alignment and tracking of the patella must be considered when determining the length of the femoral resection and the corresponding tibial resection.

This template serves as a valuable tool in ensuring accurate and reproducible resection levels during distal femoral replacement surgeries.
