QUESTION-ANSWER PAIR 3

QUESTION:
Based on the Depuy Orthogenesis LPS reference document, answer this: How do you check rotation?

ANSWER:
To check rotation during the procedure, follow these steps:

1. **Use the Trial Construct**: Begin by using the trial construct to mark the proper rotational orientation of the components.

2. **Establish Rotational Alignment**: Center the anti-rotation slot (tab) on the anterior aspect of the femur and mark the femur both proximally and distally. These marks will serve as alignment guides on either side of the femur when inserting the stems.

3. **Align the Components**: Ensure that the limb is in the correct rotation after the components are coupled together through the intercalary segmental component.

4. **Utilize an Alignment Rod**: An alignment rod can be used to aid in setting the final component position. Align the rod with the previously established markings to confirm that the desired tibial rotation is maintained.

5. **Adjust if Necessary**: If the alignment rod does not line up with the anterior marking, reduce the rotation until it does.

By following these steps, you can effectively check and ensure the correct rotational alignment of the components during the procedure.

QUESTION:
Based on the Depuy Orthogenesis LPS reference document, answer this: If the knee is too loose in flexion and extension, what are the steps we evaluate to change the construct?

ANSWER:
If the knee is too loose in flexion and extension, the following steps should be evaluated to change the construct:

1. **Evaluate Soft Tissue Tension**: 
   - Place the knee in extension and assess the soft tissue tension. This will help determine if the looseness is due to inadequate tension in the surrounding soft tissues.

2. **Check Leg Length**: 
   - Compare the medial malleoli to check for leg length discrepancies. If the leg length is slightly long, it may contribute to the looseness.

3. **Adjust Femoral Head**: 
   - If the soft tissues are loose and the femoral offset is inadequate, consider using a longer femoral head to improve stability.

4. **Use Shorter Trial Femoral Head**: 
   - If the soft tissues are tight and the leg length is long, but the femoral offset is acceptable, try using a shorter trial femoral head.

5. **Adjust Segmental Trials**: 
   - If the segmental trials are at the minimum length of 25 mm and the leg length is still long, consider recutting the femoral osteotomy to adjust for the leg length discrepancy.

6. **Re-ream the Femur**: 
   - If the femoral cut is revised, re-ream the femur distally and finish the osteotomized surface with a calcar planer/bevel reamer to ensure proper fit and avoid intraoperative fractures.

7. **Assess Femoral Anteversion**: 
   - Use the trial construct to assess proper femoral anteversion. Rotate the entire construct within the femur to achieve the required femoral anteversion (usually 10-15 degrees).

8. **Test Soft Tissue Tension**: 
   - A practical test for excessive soft tissue tension is to extend the hip and try flexing the knee. If the hip flexes when the knee flexes, it may indicate excessive soft tissue tension.

By following these steps, adjustments can be made to improve the stability of the knee construct.

   - Place the knee in extension and assess the soft tissue tension. This will help determine if the tightness is due to excessive tension in the surrounding soft tissues.

2. **Check Leg Length**: 
   - Compare the medial malleoli to check for leg length discrepancies. If the leg length is slightly long, it may contribute to the tightness.

3. **Use a Shorter Trial Femoral Head**: 
   - If the soft tissues are tight and the leg length is long, consider using a shorter trial femoral head to reduce the overall height and tension.

4. **Adjust Segmental Trials**: 
   - If the segmental trials used are at the minimum length of 25 mm and the leg length is still long, consider recutting the femoral osteotomy to adjust for the leg length discrepancy.

5. **Re-ream the Femur**: 
   - If the femoral cut is revised, re-ream the femur distally and finish the osteotomized surface with a calcar planer/bevel reamer to ensure proper fit and avoid intraoperative fractures.

6. **Assess Femoral Offset**: 
   - If the femoral offset is excessive, try reducing the vertical height/leg length by adjusting the segmental trials.

7. **Test Soft Tissue Tension**: 
   - A practical test for excessive soft tissue tension is to extend the hip and try flexing the knee. If the hip flexes when the knee flexes, it may indicate excessive soft tissue tension.

8. **Check for Proper Rotational Alignment**: 
   - Use the trial construct to assess proper femoral anteversion. Rotate the entire construct within the femur to achieve the required femoral anteversion (usually 10-15 degrees).

By following these steps, adjustments can be made to alleviate tightness in the knee construct.
