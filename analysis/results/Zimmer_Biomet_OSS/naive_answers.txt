3. **Use Reference Points**: 
   - Mark reference points on the femur and tibia to help assess the rotational alignment. This can include marking the anterior surface of the femur and the corresponding points on the tibia.

4. **Trial Components**: 
   - Use trial components to assess the fit and alignment. This allows for adjustments to be made before finalizing the implant placement.

5. **Adjust as Necessary**: 
   - If the rotation is not correct, adjustments can be made by repositioning the components or using different sizes or configurations of the implants.

6. **Final Assessment**: 
   - After making any adjustments, perform a final assessment of the rotation and alignment before proceeding with the closure of the surgical site.

By following these steps, you can effectively check and ensure proper rotational alignment of the knee components during the procedure.

3. **Use a Medialized Patellar Component**: 
   - Consider using a patellar component that is designed to be more medialized. This can help improve the tracking of the patella and reduce the tendency for lateral dislocation.

4. **Resurface the Patella**: 
   - Resurface the patella using a dome patella replacement component, such as the S-ROM or Sigma dome patella component. This can provide a better surface for patellar tracking.

5. **Reattach Soft Tissues**: 
   - If necessary, reattach the vastus lateralis and other relevant soft tissues to improve stability and alignment of the patella.

6. **Check for Adequate Soft Tissue Integrity**: 
   - Ensure that the soft tissue integrity around the knee is adequate. If there is grossly inadequate soft tissue support, consider using a knee brace postoperatively to limit flexion and provide additional support.

7. **Final Assessment**: 
   - After making adjustments, perform a final assessment of the patellar tracking and stability before proceeding with closure.

By following these steps, modifications can be made to help stabilize the patella and prevent lateral dislocation.
