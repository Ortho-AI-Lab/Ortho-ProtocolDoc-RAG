QUESTION-ANSWER PAIR 18

QUESTION:
Based on the Zimmer Biomet OSS reference document, answer this: If the knee is too loose in flexion and extension, what are the steps we evaluate to change the construct?

ANSWER:
If the knee is too loose in flexion and extension, the following steps should be evaluated to change the construct based on the Zimmer Biomet OSS reference document:

1. **Evaluate Soft Tissue Tension**: Place the knee in extension and assess the soft tissue tension around the knee. This can help determine if the components are properly aligned and if the soft tissues are contributing to instability.

2. **Check Leg Length**: Measure the leg length using reference marks on the tibia and femur. If the leg length is too long, it may lead to instability.

3. **Adjust Component Length**: If the prosthetic construct is too long, consider:
   - Removing additional bone from the femur.
   - Adjusting the length of the prosthesis.
   - Evaluating the use of a thinner insert.

4. **Reassess Alignment**: Ensure that the alignment of the femoral component is correct. Proper rotational alignment is crucial for patellar tracking.

5. **Final Range of Motion Test**: Perform a final test of the knee's range of motion with the patella in place to ensure that the adjustments have improved stability.

QUESTION-ANSWER PAIR 19

QUESTION:
Based on the Zimmer Biomet OSS reference document, answer this: If the knee is too tight in flexion and extension, what are the steps we evaluate to change the construct?

ANSWER:
If the knee is too tight in flexion and extension, the following steps should be evaluated to change the construct based on the Zimmer Biomet OSS reference document:

1. **Assess Soft Tissue Tension**: Place the knee in extension and evaluate the soft tissue tension. This assessment helps determine if the tightness is due to excessive tension in the soft tissues.

2. **Check Leg Length**: Measure the leg length using reference marks on the tibia and femur. If the leg length is too long, it may contribute to the tightness in the knee.

3. **Adjust Component Length**: If the leg length is long and the soft tissues are tight, consider:
   - Using a shorter trial femoral head to reduce tension.
   - Adjusting the vertical height or leg length by modifying the segmental trials.

4. **Reassess Resection Levels**: If the segmental trials are at the minimum length and the leg length is still long, consider recutting the femoral osteotomy to adjust for the leg length discrepancy.

5. **Re-ream the Femur**: If the femoral cut is revised, re-ream the femur distally and finish the osteotomized surface with a calcar planer/bevel reamer to ensure proper fit and avoid intraoperative fractures.

6. **Final Range of Motion Test**: Perform a final test of the knee's range of motion with the patella in place to ensure that the adjustments have improved flexibility.

7. **Postoperative Care**: Implement a postoperative care plan that may include bracing or physical therapy to further support the knee and improve motion.

These steps are essential for ensuring that the knee construct is appropriately adjusted for optimal function and comfort postoperatively.

1. **Reattach Soft Tissues**: Ensure that the vastus lateralis and other relevant soft tissues are properly reattached to provide additional support to the patella.

2. **Evaluate Component Alignment**: Check the alignment of the femoral component. Proper rotational alignment is crucial for patellar tracking. Adjust the alignment as necessary to improve the position of the patella.

3. **Use of a Thicker Insert**: If patellar tracking remains inadequate, consider using a thicker polyethylene insert to help stabilize the patella.

4. **Suture the Iliopsoas Muscle**: If appropriate, suture the iliopsoas muscle to the medial aspect of the proximal femoral body replacement component to enhance stability.

5. **Final Range of Motion Test**: After making adjustments, perform a final test of the knee's range of motion with the patella in place to ensure that the modifications have improved stability and tracking.

6. **Postoperative Care**: Implement a postoperative care plan that may include bracing or physical therapy to further support the knee and improve patellar tracking.
