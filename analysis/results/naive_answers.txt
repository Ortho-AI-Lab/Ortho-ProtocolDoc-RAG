QUESTION-ANSWER PAIR 2

QUESTION:
Is there a press fit or cementless option?

ANSWER:
Yes, there are options for press-fit or cementless distal femoral components. The press-fit stem can be used without cement, allowing for bony ingrowth into the implant. This is particularly relevant when using specific tibial trays, such as the S-ROM tibial tray, where only the cut tibia surface is cemented, while the stem itself is press-fit.

Additionally, there are porous stems designed for press-fit insertion, which can be impacted into place to ensure stability and proper alignment without the use of cement.

QUESTION-ANSWER PAIR 3

QUESTION:
How do you check rotation?

ANSWER:
To check the rotation of the distal femoral component during surgery, follow these steps:

1. **Use Trial Components**: Assemble the trial components and insert them into the femur. This allows you to evaluate the fit and orientation of the components.

2. **Assess Joint Line**: Compare the knee joint line to the opposite side to ensure proper height and alignment. The joint line is determined by the level of the femoral component.

3. **Mark Orientation**: Once the proper orientation is established, use the anti-rotation slot (tab) on the trial component as a reference to mark the femur. This mark will serve as an alignment guide when inserting the final implant.

4. **Evaluate Fit and Stability**: Use the trial construct to assess not only the rotational orientation but also the leg length, joint stability, soft tissue tension, and range of motion.

5. **Adjust if Necessary**: If the trial components indicate that the rotation is not correct, adjustments can be made before finalizing the implant placement.

By following these steps, you can ensure that the distal femoral component is properly aligned and oriented during the procedure.

QUESTION-ANSWER PAIR 5

QUESTION:
What degree do I cut the tibia in?

ANSWER:
The specific angle for cutting the tibia during a distal femoral replacement is not explicitly stated in the retrieved information. However, it is generally important to ensure that the tibial cut is made at a level that aligns properly with the femoral component and maintains the joint line.

In practice, the tibial cut is typically made at a **perpendicular angle** to the mechanical axis of the tibia, which helps in achieving proper alignment and stability of the implant. It is also crucial to use trial components to assess the fit and alignment before finalizing the cut.

For precise surgical techniques, it is advisable to refer to specific surgical guidelines or protocols provided by the implant manufacturer or consult with experienced orthopedic surgeons.

QUESTION-ANSWER PAIR 16

QUESTION:
Is there a distal femur resection guide for measurement?

ANSWER:
Yes, there is a distal femur resection guide designed for measurement. The **Distal Femoral Template** is used to guide the resection to a level that can be reproduced by the available implants. Here are the key points regarding its use:

1. **Placement**: The template is placed on the bone so that its silhouette coincides with the distal condyles of the femur.

2. **Marking**: The anterior cortex of the femur is marked with a bovie or similar device to indicate the resection level. 

3. **Measurement**: It is important to ensure proper patellar tracking and to consider the length of the femoral resection in relation to the tibial resection to recreate leg length.

4. **Reference Measurements**: A reference measurement can be established across the joint by marking the femur and tibia before resection. This allows for checking the distance after the resection is made.

5. **Additional Markings**: Horizontal lines can be marked on the femur above and below the proposed resection levels to assist in leg length measurement.

This guide helps ensure accurate and reproducible measurements during the surgical procedure.
