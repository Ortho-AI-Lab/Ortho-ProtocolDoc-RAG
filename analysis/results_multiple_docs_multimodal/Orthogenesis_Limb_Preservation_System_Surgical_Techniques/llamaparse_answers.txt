QUESTION-ANSWER PAIR 15

QUESTION:
Based on the document titled Orthogenesis Limb Preservation System Surgical Techniques from DePuy, answer this question:

What is the minimum reamer I have to use on the femur and tibia?

ANSWER:
The minimum reamer size for the femur is typically determined by using a pilot that is 1 mm smaller than the last intramedullary (IM) reamer used. For example, if the final stem extension size is 15.5 mm, a 15 mm pilot would be used. 

For the tibia, the smallest diameter mentioned for cemented stems is 10 mm, suggesting that the minimum reamer size could be slightly smaller than this to allow for a cement mantle.

QUESTION-ANSWER PAIR 18

QUESTION:
Based on the document titled Orthogenesis Limb Preservation System Surgical Techniques from DePuy, answer this question:

If the knee does not fully extend, what are the steps we evaluate to change the construct?

ANSWER:
If the knee does not fully extend, the following steps should be evaluated to change the construct:

1. **Trial Reduction**: Ensure proper assembly and alignment of trial components, checking for discrepancies in leg length and joint stability.

2. **Soft Tissue Management**: Evaluate soft tissue tension and consider releases if necessary, as tight soft tissues can impede full extension.

3. **Component Adjustment**: Adjust the femoral and tibial components for proper alignment and fit, which may involve changing the length of segmental trials or adjusting the femoral head length.

4. **Postoperative Care**: Consider using a knee brace to limit flexion and ensure proper healing if soft tissue integrity is compromised.

QUESTION-ANSWER PAIR 21

QUESTION:
Based on the document titled Orthogenesis Limb Preservation System Surgical Techniques from DePuy, answer this question:

What are the choices for the tibial component in the setting of a distal femur fracture? How do I decide which is the best option?

ANSWER:
The choices for the tibial component in the setting of a distal femur fracture include:

1. **S-ROM Tibial Tray**: Use the S-ROM hinged tibial insert bearing.
2. **M.B.T. Revision Tibial Tray**: Use the Orthogenesis LPS hinged tibial insert bearing.

To decide which is the best option, consider the specific system being employed (S-ROM or M.B.T.) and ensure that the size of the tibial component matches the size of the distal femoral replacement component. For instance, use the LPS extra-small hinged tibial insert bearing with the Orthogenesis LPS extra-small Distal Femoral Replacement component, and similarly for extra-extra small components.

QUESTION-ANSWER PAIR 22

QUESTION:
Based on the document titled Orthogenesis Limb Preservation System Surgical Techniques from DePuy, answer this question:

If I can’t get diaphyseal fixation in the femur, what are the options?

ANSWER:
If diaphyseal fixation in the femur cannot be achieved, options include using a "prophylactic" cerclage wire around the proximal end of the diaphysis to reduce fracture risk during insertion, particularly in fragile bones. Additionally, if the implant with a porous stem does not advance, you can disassemble it using a disassembly tool, clean the tapers, and reinsert the implant after re-reaming.
