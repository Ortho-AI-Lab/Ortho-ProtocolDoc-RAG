QUESTION-ANSWER PAIR 21

QUESTION:
Based on the document titled Segmental Distal Femoral Replacement Surgical Technique from Zimmer Biomet, answer this question:

What are the choices for the tibial component in the setting of a distal femur fracture? How do I decide which is the best option?

ANSWER:
The choices for the tibial component in the setting of a distal femur fracture are:

1. **Short Non-Modular Tibial Component**
2. **Modular without a Stem**
3. **Long Non-Modular Tibial Component**
4. **Modular with a Stem**

To decide which is the best option, consider the following:

- **Short Non-Modular vs. Long Non-Modular**: Choose based on the required length and stability; longer components may provide more stability.
- **Modular vs. Non-Modular**: Modular components offer flexibility and customization, especially if a stem is needed for additional support.
- **Stem Consideration**: If additional support is needed, a modular component with a stem might be preferable.

The decision should be based on the specific clinical scenario, including the extent of the fracture, bone quality, and the need for additional stability or customization.
