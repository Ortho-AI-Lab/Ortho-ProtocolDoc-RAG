QUESTION:
Based on the document titled GMRS Distal Femur and Revision Baseplate Surgical Protocol from Stryker, answer this question:

If the knee does not fully extend, what are the steps we evaluate to change the construct?

ANSWER:
To address the issue of the knee not fully extending, the following steps should be evaluated:

1. **Check Extension Gap**: Ensure the extension gap is adequately filled when the knee is brought to full extension (0 degrees).

QUESTION-ANSWER PAIR 21

QUESTION:
Based on the document titled GMRS Distal Femur and Revision Baseplate Surgical Protocol from Stryker, answer this question:

What are the choices for the tibial component in the setting of a distal femur fracture? How do I decide which is the best option?

ANSWER:
In the setting of a distal femur fracture, the choices for the tibial component include various sizes of the Triathlon Revision Baseplate and tibial inserts. The tibial insert size must match the baseplate size, and the Hinge Insert can only be used with the cemented Revision Baseplate. Additionally, tibial augments are available in specific configurations and sizes to match the Revision Baseplate.

To decide which option is best, consider the following:

1. **Size Matching**: Ensure the tibial insert matches the baseplate size.
2. **Configuration Needs**: Choose tibial augments based on the specific medial/lateral configuration required.
3. **Compatibility**: Ensure compatibility with other components, such as the Triathlon Hinge Tibial Bearing Component.

This information is derived from the document, which outlines the compatibility and options for tibial components in the surgical protocol.
