Question: Based on the document titled Segmental Distal Femoral Replacement Surgical Technique from Zimmer Biomet, answer this question:

How do you check rotation?
Answer: To check rotation during a Segmental Distal Femoral Replacement, a straight edge like the Distal Femoral Template is used to mark the anterior cortex of the distal femur above the resection level. This mark aligns with the trochlear groove and serves as a reference for rotational orientation. During trial evaluations, this alignment can be verified, and the alignment marking on the implant stem should match this mark on the anterior cortex.

Question: Based on the document titled Segmental Distal Femoral Replacement Surgical Technique from Zimmer Biomet, answer this question:

What is the minimum reamer I have to use on the femur and tibia?
Answer: For the femur, the canal should be reamed to a size 2mm larger than the chosen stem diameter. The smallest available stem diameter is 8mm, so the minimum reamer size for the femur would be 10mm.

For the tibia, begin with the smallest diameter flexible reamer and sequentially increase in 0.5 mm increments until light cortical chatter is achieved. The specific minimum size is not provided, but the process involves starting with the smallest available reamer.

Question: Based on the document titled Segmental Distal Femoral Replacement Surgical Technique from Zimmer Biomet, answer this question:

If the knee is too recurvatum in flexion and extension, what are the steps we evaluate to change the construct? What can we do with the bumper in this scenario?
Answer: The content provided does not directly address the steps to evaluate and change the construct if the knee is too recurvatum in flexion and extension, nor does it mention specific adjustments to the bumper in this scenario. Therefore, based on general surgical principles, if the knee is too recurvatum, adjustments may include altering the tension of soft tissues, changing component positioning, or adjusting the implant size or alignment. The bumper, if used in a hinge mechanism, may need to be adjusted or replaced to correct the alignment and balance of the knee joint. However, specific steps from the document would be required for a precise answer.
