Question: Based on the document titled Orthogenesis Limb Preservation System Surgical Techniques from DePuy, answer this question:

How do you check rotation?
Answer: To check rotation in the Orthogenesis Limb Preservation System, a straight edge, such as the Distal Femoral Template, is used to mark the anterior cortex of the distal femur above the resection level. This mark aligns with the trochlear groove of the distal femur and serves as a reference for the rotational orientation of the prosthetic components. The alignment marking on the implant stem should match this mark to ensure proper rotational alignment, which can be verified during trial evaluations.

Question: Based on the document titled Orthogenesis Limb Preservation System Surgical Techniques from DePuy, answer this question:

If the knee does not fully extend, what are the steps we evaluate to change the construct?
Answer: If the knee does not fully extend, evaluate the soft tissue tension and consider making adjustments to the femoral length by changing the segmental trial lengths. Also, assess the joint line height and ensure proper anteversion, offset, and stability. Adjustments can be made using different femoral head lengths and varying tibial insert polyethylene heights to achieve proper extension and joint stability.

Question: Based on the document titled Orthogenesis Limb Preservation System Surgical Techniques from DePuy, answer this question:

What are the choices for the tibial component in the setting of a distal femur fracture? How do I decide which is the best option?
Answer: For a distal femur fracture, the choices for the tibial component include:

- Short Non-Modular Tibial Component
- Modular without a Stem
- Long Non-Modular Tibial Component
- Modular with a Stem

To decide which option is the best, consider the specific needs of the patient, such as the required coverage of the tibial plateau, the need for stability, and whether a modular or non-modular component is more appropriate. The modular options accommodate a stem, which may offer additional support if needed.
