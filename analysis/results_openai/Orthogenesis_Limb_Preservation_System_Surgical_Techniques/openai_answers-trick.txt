Question: Based on the document titled Orthogenesis Limb Preservation System Surgical Techniques from DePuy, answer this question:

If I am unhappy with the distal femoral replacement trials but decide to use a cruciate retaining implant, what’s the next step?
Answer: If you are unhappy with the distal femoral replacement trials but decide to use a cruciate retaining implant, the next step would be to ensure proper alignment and fit of the implant. This involves reassessing the femoral osteotomy and potentially re-reaming the femur more proximally if adjustments are needed. You should also use the trial components to ensure the correct rotational orientation and leg length before proceeding with the final implant insertion.

Question: Based on the document titled Orthogenesis Limb Preservation System Surgical Techniques from DePuy, answer this question:

Is this implant ACL preserving?
Answer: The content provided does not mention whether the Orthogenesis Limb Preservation System is ACL preserving. Therefore, I cannot determine if this implant is ACL preserving based on the document.

Question: Based on the document titled Orthogenesis Limb Preservation System Surgical Techniques from DePuy, answer this question:

Is the DFR better for patients than a cruciate retaining or posterior stabilized total knee replacement?
Answer: The content provided does not discuss whether a Distal Femoral Replacement (DFR) is better for patients than a cruciate retaining or posterior stabilized total knee replacement. Therefore, based on the content, I cannot determine which option is better for patients.

Question: Based on the document titled Orthogenesis Limb Preservation System Surgical Techniques from DePuy, answer this question:

Is this DFR a kinematic knee?
Answer: The content provided does not specify whether the DFR (Distal Femoral Replacement) is a kinematic knee. A kinematic knee typically refers to a type of knee replacement that aims to mimic the natural motion of the knee more closely. The document focuses on the surgical technique and components involved in distal femoral replacement but does not mention if it is designed as a kinematic knee. Therefore, based on the content, it is not clear if this DFR is a kinematic knee.

Question: Based on the document titled Orthogenesis Limb Preservation System Surgical Techniques from DePuy, answer this question:

How do we manage the meniscus during DFR surgery?
Answer: I'm sorry, but the provided content does not include specific information on managing the meniscus during distal femoral replacement (DFR) surgery. You may need to consult the document directly or seek guidance from a surgical expert for detailed instructions on meniscus management during this procedure.

Question: Based on the document titled Orthogenesis Limb Preservation System Surgical Techniques from DePuy, answer this question:

Is the DFR appropriate for hip arthritis?
Answer: The DFR (Distal Femoral Replacement) in the context of the Orthogenesis Limb Preservation System is not specifically indicated for hip arthritis. It is designed to address severe lower extremity bone loss due to conditions like neoplasms, infections, massive trauma, or failed joint replacements. Hip arthritis is not mentioned as an indication for this system.

Question: Based on the document titled Orthogenesis Limb Preservation System Surgical Techniques from DePuy, answer this question:

Which is the best DFR on the market?
Answer: The content provided does not specify which Distal Femoral Replacement (DFR) is the best on the market. It discusses the Orthogenesis™ Limb Preservation System but does not compare it to other systems or claim it is the best. Therefore, I cannot determine which DFR is the best based on the given document.

Question: Based on the document titled Orthogenesis Limb Preservation System Surgical Techniques from DePuy, answer this question:

How long before the patient can return to running after DFR?
Answer: The content provided does not include specific information about when a patient can return to running after a distal femoral replacement (DFR). Typically, the timeline for returning to activities like running would depend on various factors, including the patient's recovery progress, the type of implant used, and the surgeon's recommendations. It is best to consult directly with the healthcare provider for personalized guidance.
