Question: Based on the document titled GMRS Distal Femur and Revision Baseplate Surgical Protocol from Stryker, answer this question:

Is the DFR better for patients than a cruciate retaining or posterior stabilized total knee replacement?
Answer: The content provided does not address whether the GMRS Distal Femur Replacement (DFR) is better than a cruciate retaining or posterior stabilized total knee replacement. The GMRS system is typically used for complex cases such as tumors or severe trauma, whereas cruciate retaining or posterior stabilized knee replacements are more common for general osteoarthritis. The choice between these depends on specific patient conditions and surgical goals. Therefore, it is not possible to definitively say which is better without considering individual patient factors and surgical indications.
