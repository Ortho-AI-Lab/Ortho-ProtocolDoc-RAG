- Standard: 54 mm A/P (60 mm M/L)


-----------------
Question: Based on the document titled GMRS Distal Femur and Revision Baseplate Surgical Protocol from Stryker, answer this question:

Is there a press fit or cementless option?
Answer: Yes. The protocol includes a Revision Baseplate with Fluted Stem option, where cement is applied to the tibial surface only (no retrograde canal fill), indicating a press-fit/cementless stem. There is also a fully cemented stem option.


-----------------
Question: Based on the document titled GMRS Distal Femur and Revision Baseplate Surgical Protocol from Stryker, answer this question:

How do you check rotation?
Answer: Use a straight edge (e.g., the Distal Femoral Template) to mark the anterior cortex above the resection level in line with the trochlear groove (directly anterior to the linea aspera). During trialing/implantation, align the stem’s rotational marking with this cortical mark to confirm rotation.


-----------------
Question: Based on the document titled GMRS Distal Femur and Revision Baseplate Surgical Protocol from Stryker, answer this question:

What is the shortest construct I can use?
Answer: The shortest construct is the Distal Femoral Component attached directly to a cemented stem with no extension piece—use the stem without the extra‑cortical porous‑coated body section (11 mm replacement length).


-----------------
Question: Based on the document titled GMRS Distal Femur and Revision Baseplate Surgical Protocol from Stryker, answer this question:

-----------------
Question: Based on the document titled GMRS Distal Femur and Revision Baseplate Surgical Protocol from Stryker, answer this question:

If the knee does not fully extend, what are the steps we evaluate to change the construct?
Answer: - Bring the knee to full extension and palpate femoral pulses. If pulses are diminished in extension and improve with flexion, the construct is too long/tight and needs to be shortened.
- Recheck the tibial–femoral leg-length reference marks.
- Compare the distal femoral resection length to the assembled prosthesis length.
- If too long/tight, modify the construct by:
  - Removing additional distal femoral bone, or
  - Shortening/adjusting the prosthesis length, or
  - Using a thinner insert (shift the Hinge Trial Bearing Plate to a thinner slot); adjust the Trial Bumper angle as needed.
- If shortening the femur/construct would compromise patellar tracking, remove additional bone from the tibial side instead.
- Reassess to ensure full extension, proper patellar tracking, and acceptable distal pulses before accepting final length.


-----------------
Question: Based on the document titled GMRS Distal Femur and Revision Baseplate Surgical Protocol from Stryker, answer this question:

If the knee is too recurvatum in flexion and extension, what are the steps we evaluate to change the construct? What can we do with the bumper in this scenario?
Answer: - Evaluate and adjust insert thickness: with the knee at 90°, shift the Hinge Trial Bearing Plate to the next slot (thicker insert) and then check the extension gap at 0°. Repeat trial reduction as needed.
- Adjust the bumper: change the Trial Bumper angle as required; in this setting, select the 3° flexion bumper (instead of neutral) to bias the knee into flexion and reduce recurvatum.


-----------------
Question: Based on the document titled GMRS Distal Femur and Revision Baseplate Surgical Protocol from Stryker, answer this question:

If the patella is laterally dislocating, what can be done to modify the tibia?
Answer: Medialize the tibial tubercle (tibial tubercle osteotomy/transfer) to improve patellar tracking and prevent lateral dislocation.


-----------------
Question: Based on the document titled GMRS Distal Femur and Revision Baseplate Surgical Protocol from Stryker, answer this question:

What are the choices for the tibial component in the setting of a distal femur fracture? How do I decide which is the best option?
Answer: Choices
- GMRS Revision Tibial Baseplate (offsetting not possible), paired with:
  - Tibial Sleeve
  - Tibial Augments (5 mm or 10 mm, attached under the baseplate)
  - Compatible Tibial Bearing Component and Tibial Insert

How to decide
- Size and position with the Universal Tibial Template; attach the Tibial Alignment Handle for sizing.
- If you made augment cuts, attach Tibial Augment Trials to the underside of the template to confirm need for 5 mm or 10 mm augments.
- Verify rotation and alignment using the Revision Keel Punch Guide and Universal Alignment Rod.
- Because offsetting is not available with the Revision baseplate, choose the baseplate size and position that achieve coverage and alignment without offset.


-----------------
Question: Based on the document titled GMRS Distal Femur and Revision Baseplate Surgical Protocol from Stryker, answer this question:

If I can’t get diaphyseal fixation in the femur, what are the options?
Answer: - Cement the femoral stem (use a cement restrictor and rely on metaphyseal/cement fixation rather than press-fit diaphyseal purchase).
- Use an allograft-prosthetic composite to restore length and allow stem fixation.
- If adequate fixation still isn’t achievable, convert to a total femur replacement.


-----------------
Question: Based on the document titled GMRS Distal Femur and Revision Baseplate Surgical Protocol from Stryker, answer this question:

When should a distal femoral replacement be used or considered?
Answer: Consider a distal femoral replacement when there is extensive distal femoral bone loss or pathology that cannot be reliably reconstructed with standard arthroplasty techniques (stems, augments, cones), including:
- Oncologic indications: limb-sparing reconstruction after resection of primary bone tumors or metastatic disease/pathologic fracture of the distal femur.
- Failed total knee arthroplasty with massive distal femoral bone loss and/or collateral ligament insufficiency requiring a linked/hinged construct.
- Periprosthetic or native distal femur fractures that are unreconstructable (severely comminuted, osteoporotic, poor bone stock), especially in low-demand or elderly patients.
- Salvage after multiple revisions or infection with segmental bone loss where stable fixation of conventional components is not feasible.
- Acute traumatic distal femur destruction that is not reconstructable, as a limb-salvage alternative to above-knee amputation.


-----------------
Question: Based on the document titled GMRS Distal Femur and Revision Baseplate Surgical Protocol from Stryker, answer this question:

What can I do with the distal femoral component if I can’t close the retinaculum?
Answer: Slightly externally rotate the distal femoral component to improve patellar tracking, which can facilitate retinacular (capsular) closure.


-----------------
Question: Based on the document titled GMRS Distal Femur and Revision Baseplate Surgical Protocol from Stryker, answer this question:

If I have patellar impingement on the mechanism, what are my choices to modify the construct?
Answer: Options to modify the construct for patellar impingement on the mechanism:

- Switch the bumper: use the 3° flexion bumper instead of neutral to slightly flex the knee in extension and improve clearance.
- Adjust femoral component rotation: slight external rotation may aid patellar tracking.
- Modify construct length/joint line:
  - Change insert thickness by moving to a different bearing plate slot (thinner if the construct is too long).
  - If still too long, shorten the construct by removing additional bone or adjusting prosthesis length; if femoral shortening worsens tracking, remove bone from the tibial side.


-----------------
Question: Based on the document titled GMRS Distal Femur and Revision Baseplate Surgical Protocol from Stryker, answer this question:

What are the bumper and poly options in my construct?
Answer: - Bumper options: Neutral (6481-2-130) or 3° flexion (6481-2-133). Trial bumpers: 6543-6-101/103.
- Poly (tibial insert) options: Use the Triathlon Hinge Tibial Bearing Component, Size 1–2 (5612-0-001). Insert size must match the baseplate size, and thickness is selected based on the Trial Bearing Plate slots. The hinge insert is only used with the cemented Revision Baseplate.


-----------------
Question: Based on the document titled GMRS Distal Femur and Revision Baseplate Surgical Protocol from Stryker, answer this question:

Is this a central femoral hinge or posterior consular hinge? Which has better quad efficiency and lower dislocation rate?
Answer: Posterior condylar hinge. Posterior condylar designs generally provide better quadriceps efficiency and a lower dislocation rate than central femoral hinges.


-----------------
Question: Based on the document titled GMRS Distal Femur and Revision Baseplate Surgical Protocol from Stryker, answer this question:

Is there an all poly tibial baseplate option if I wanted to use it as a spacer?
