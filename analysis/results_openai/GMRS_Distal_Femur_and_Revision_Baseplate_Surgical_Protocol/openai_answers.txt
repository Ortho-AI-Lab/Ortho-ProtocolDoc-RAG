Question: Based on the document titled GMRS Distal Femur and Revision Baseplate Surgical Protocol from Stryker, answer this question:

How do you check rotation?
Answer: To check rotation in the GMRS Distal Femur and Revision Baseplate procedure, you use a straight edge, such as the Distal Femoral Template, to mark the anterior cortex of the distal femur above the resection level. This mark should align with the trochlear groove of the distal femur. The alignment marking on the implant stem should match this mark to ensure correct rotational orientation. This can be verified during trial evaluations.

Question: Based on the document titled GMRS Distal Femur and Revision Baseplate Surgical Protocol from Stryker, answer this question:

If the knee does not fully extend, what are the steps we evaluate to change the construct?
Answer: If the knee does not fully extend, the protocol suggests evaluating the construct by:

1. Checking if the prosthetic construct is too long and rechecking the length of the distal femoral bone resected against the assembled prosthesis.
2. If too long, consider removing additional bone from the femur or tibia, adjusting the length of the prosthesis, or using a thinner insert.
3. Assessing patellar tracking and distal pulses, as these are crucial for determining the adequacy of the resection length.
4. If necessary, adjusting the insert thickness or Trial Bumper angle to ensure proper extension and stability.

Question: Based on the document titled GMRS Distal Femur and Revision Baseplate Surgical Protocol from Stryker, answer this question:

If I have patellar impingement on the mechanism, what are my choices to modify the construct?
Answer: If you have patellar impingement on the mechanism, you can consider adjusting the rotation of the femoral component, as slight external rotation may aid in patellar tracking. Additionally, you might evaluate the prosthetic construct's length and consider removing additional bone from the tibial side if needed. Adjusting the insert thickness or the angle of the bumper could also be options to modify the construct and improve patellar tracking.
