QUESTION-ANSWER PAIR 21

QUESTION:
Based on the document titled Distal Femoral Replacement Surgical Technique: Passive Fixed Hinge Tibia Option from Onkos, answer this question:

What are the choices for the tibial component in the setting of a distal femur fracture? How do I decide which is the best option?

ANSWER:
In the setting of a distal femur fracture, the choices for the tibial component include:

1. **Cemented Stem**: This option involves cementing the tibial component into the tibia, which can provide stability, especially in cases where bone quality is compromised.

2. **Fixed Hinge Tibial Component**: This component is designed to work with the femoral component to allow for articulation and stability during movement.

3. **Tibial Passive Stem**: This option may be used depending on the specific requirements of the surgical procedure and the patient's anatomy.

To decide which is the best option, consider the following factors:

- **Fracture Characteristics**: Assess the type and extent of the distal femur fracture. More complex fractures may benefit from the stability provided by a cemented stem.

- **Patient Anatomy**: Evaluate the patient's anatomy and the amount of remaining bone. If there is significant bone loss, a cemented option may provide better support.

- **Surgical Goals**: Consider the goals of the surgery, including the desired range of motion and stability of the knee joint postoperatively.

- **Soft Tissue Integrity**: Assess the condition of the surrounding soft tissues, as this may influence the choice of tibial component.

By evaluating these factors, you can determine the most appropriate tibial component for the specific clinical scenario.

QUESTION-ANSWER PAIR 22

QUESTION:
Based on the document titled Distal Femoral Replacement Surgical Technique: Passive Fixed Hinge Tibia Option from Onkos, answer this question:

If I can’t get diaphyseal fixation in the femur, what are the options?

ANSWER:
If diaphyseal fixation in the femur cannot be achieved, the following options may be considered:

1. **Cemented Stem**: Use a cemented stem to provide stability when adequate bone quality for mechanical fixation is not available. Ensure that no cement adheres to the HA coated collar to promote proper bony ingrowth.

2. **Extra-Cortical Plate**: If the femoral component has an extra-cortical plate incorporated into the shaft, implant-grade titanium alloy screws can be used to secure the component, providing additional stability.

3. **Alternative Fixation Techniques**: Depending on the specific clinical scenario, consider using alternative fixation methods such as plates or external fixators to provide additional support.

4. **Soft Tissue Management**: Evaluate the soft tissue integrity around the knee. If there is inadequate soft tissue coverage, mobilizing remaining musculature may be necessary to achieve proper coverage around the prosthesis.

5. **Evaluate for Additional Procedures**: In some cases, additional surgical procedures may be necessary to enhance fixation or stability, such as bone grafting or the use of adjunctive devices.

These options should be evaluated based on the individual patient's anatomy, the extent of the fracture, and the overall surgical plan.

QUESTION:
Based on the document titled Distal Femoral Replacement Surgical Technique: Passive Fixed Hinge Tibia Option from Onkos, answer this question:

What can I do with the distal femoral component if I can’t close the retinaculum?

ANSWER:
If you cannot close the retinaculum after placing the distal femoral component, consider the following options:

1. **Evaluate Soft Tissue Integrity**: Assess the condition of the soft tissues around the knee. If there is excessive tension or inadequate soft tissue coverage, consider mobilizing or reconstructing the soft tissues to improve stability and alignment.

2. **Reassess Component Positioning**: Check the alignment and positioning of the tibial and femoral components. Misalignment can lead to tension on the retinaculum, making closure difficult.

3. **Use of Sutures**: If possible, use sutures to reattach any available soft tissue structures to the appropriate anatomical locations, which can help provide additional support and stability.

4. **Close with Knee in Extension**: If soft tissue integrity is compromised, consider closing the wound with the knee in full extension to minimize tension on the retinaculum.

5. **Postoperative Care**: Implement a postoperative care plan that includes monitoring for complications and ensuring that the knee is stabilized appropriately.

These steps aim to enhance the stability of the knee joint and ensure proper healing after surgery.
