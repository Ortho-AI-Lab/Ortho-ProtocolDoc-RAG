QUESTION:
Based on the document titled GMRS Distal Femur and Revision Baseplate Surgical Protocol from Stryker, answer this question:

What are the choices for the tibial component in the setting of a distal femur fracture? How do I decide which is the best option?

ANSWER:
In the setting of a distal femur fracture, the choices for the tibial component include:

1. **Tibial Components**: The Triathlon Revision Baseplate is available in 7 sizes (1-7), with modular stem options. The tibial inserts are available in sizes 1-7 with thicknesses of 11 mm, 13 mm, 16 mm, 19 mm, and 22 mm.

To decide which is the best option, consider the following factors:

- **Fracture Characteristics**: Assess the type and extent of the distal femur fracture. More complex fractures may benefit from the stability provided by a modular component.

- **Patient Anatomy**: Evaluate the patient's anatomy and the amount of remaining bone. If there is significant bone loss, a modular option may provide better support.

- **Surgical Goals**: Consider the goals of the surgery, including the desired range of motion and stability of the knee joint postoperatively.

QUESTION-ANSWER PAIR 22

QUESTION:
Based on the document titled GMRS Distal Femur and Revision Baseplate Surgical Protocol from Stryker, answer this question:

If I can’t get diaphyseal fixation in the femur, what are the options?

ANSWER:
If diaphyseal fixation in the femur cannot be achieved, the following options may be considered:

1. **Cemented Stem**: Use a cemented stem to provide stability when adequate bone quality for mechanical fixation is not available. Ensure that the cement is applied correctly to facilitate proper bonding.

2. **Extra-Cortical Plate**: If the femoral component has an extra-cortical plate incorporated into the shaft, use implant-grade titanium alloy screws to secure the component, providing additional stability.

3. **Alternative Fixation Techniques**: Depending on the specific clinical scenario, consider using alternative fixation methods such as plates or external fixators to provide additional support.

4. **Bone Preservation**: During any revision procedures, take care to preserve as much of the remaining bone stock as possible to avoid the risk of fracture of the residual bone.

5. **Soft Tissue Management**: Evaluate the soft tissue integrity around the knee. If there is inadequate soft tissue coverage, mobilizing remaining musculature may be necessary to achieve proper coverage around the prosthesis.

These options should be evaluated based on the individual patient's anatomy, the extent of the fracture, and the overall surgical plan.

QUESTION-ANSWER PAIR 24

QUESTION:
Based on the document titled GMRS Distal Femur and Revision Baseplate Surgical Protocol from Stryker, answer this question:

What can I do with the distal femoral component if I can’t close the retinaculum?

ANSWER:
If you cannot close the retinaculum after placing the distal femoral component, consider the following options:

1. **Evaluate Soft Tissue Tension**: Assess the soft tissue tension around the knee joint while the knee is in extension. This evaluation helps determine if excessive tension is preventing closure.

2. **Check Component Alignment**: Ensure that the tibial and femoral components are properly aligned. Misalignment can lead to tension on the retinaculum, making closure difficult.

3. **Use of Sutures**: If possible, use sutures to reattach any available soft tissue structures to the appropriate anatomical locations, which can help provide additional support and stability.

4. **Close with Knee in Extension**: If soft tissue integrity is compromised, consider closing the wound with the knee in full extension to minimize tension on the retinaculum.

5. **Postoperative Care**: Implement a postoperative care plan that includes monitoring for complications and ensuring that the knee is stabilized appropriately.

These steps aim to enhance the stability of the knee joint and ensure proper healing after surgery.
