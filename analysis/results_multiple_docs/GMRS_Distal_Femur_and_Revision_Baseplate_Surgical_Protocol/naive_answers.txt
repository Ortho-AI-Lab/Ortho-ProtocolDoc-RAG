QUESTION-ANSWER PAIR 2

QUESTION:
Based on the document titled GMRS Distal Femur and Revision Baseplate Surgical Protocol from Stryker, answer this question:

Is there a press fit or cementless option?

ANSWER:
Yes, there is a press fit or cementless option available in the GMRS Distal Femur and Revision Baseplate system from Stryker. The system allows for the use of a cemented stem, but it can also accommodate a cementless approach depending on the specific needs of the patient and the surgical situation.

For cementless applications, the use of a porous-coated stem is typically recommended, which allows for biological fixation to the bone. This option is particularly useful in cases where cement fixation is not desired or feasible. 

When considering the best option, factors such as the patient's bone quality, the specific type of fracture or condition being treated, and the surgeon's experience and preference should be taken into account.

QUESTION-ANSWER PAIR 3

QUESTION:
Based on the document titled GMRS Distal Femur and Revision Baseplate Surgical Protocol from Stryker, answer this question:

How do you check rotation?

ANSWER:
To check rotation during the Segmental Distal Femoral Replacement procedure, follow these steps:

1. **Mark the Anterior Cortex**: Using a straight edge, mark the anterior cortex of the distal femur above the resection level in line with the trochlear groove. This mark will serve as a reference for rotational orientation.

2. **Align the Stem Implants**: During the trial evaluation, ensure that the stem implants and trials are aligned with the mark made on the anterior cortex. This helps verify that the rotational alignment is correct.

3. **Use the Distal Femoral Template**: The Distal Femoral Template can be used to assist in determining and verifying rotational alignment. Ensure that the alignment marking on the implant stem is oriented to the reference mark made on the femur.

4. **Trial Evaluation**: During the trial evaluation, assess the fit and alignment of the components to confirm that the rotation is appropriate for optimal function.

By following these steps, you can ensure that the rotational alignment of the distal femoral component is correct, which is crucial for optimal knee function and stability.

QUESTION-ANSWER PAIR 20

QUESTION:
Based on the document titled GMRS Distal Femur and Revision Baseplate Surgical Protocol from Stryker, answer this question:

If the patella is laterally dislocating, what can be done to modify the tibia?

ANSWER:
If the patella is laterally dislocating, the following modifications can be made to the tibia:

2. **Select Appropriate Tibial Bearing**: Choose a tibial bearing that allows for proper patellar tracking. Ensure that the bearing is compatible with the femoral component to maintain joint stability.

3. **Modify the Bumper**: If applicable, adjust the height or design of the bumper to provide better support and alignment for the patella, which can help alleviate dislocation.

4. **Resurface the Patella**: Consider resurfacing the patella using a dome patella replacement component to improve tracking and reduce the risk of dislocation.

5. **Trial Components**: Use trial components to assess fit and alignment before finalizing the tibial component. This allows for adjustments based on the patient's anatomy and the specific mechanics of the knee.

6. **Evaluate Soft Tissue Integrity**: Assess the integrity of the surrounding soft tissues, as inadequate soft tissue support can contribute to patellar instability and dislocation.

QUESTION-ANSWER PAIR 21

QUESTION:
Based on the document titled GMRS Distal Femur and Revision Baseplate Surgical Protocol from Stryker, answer this question:

What are the choices for the tibial component in the setting of a distal femur fracture? How do I decide which is the best option?

ANSWER:
In the setting of a distal femur fracture, the choices for the tibial component include:

1. **Short Non-Modular Tibial Component**: This option provides a fixed length and is suitable for certain cases where modularity is not required.

2. **Modular Tibial Component without a Stem**: This allows for flexibility in assembly and can be adjusted based on the specific needs of the patient.

3. **Long Non-Modular Tibial Component**: Similar to the short non-modular option but provides a longer length for cases requiring more support.

4. **Modular Tibial Component with a Stem**: This option provides additional stability and can be tailored to the patient's anatomy.

### Deciding the Best Option:
To determine the best tibial component option, consider the following factors:

- **Patient Anatomy**: Assess the patient's bone quality and anatomy to choose a component that provides adequate support and stability.

- **Type of Fracture**: The nature of the distal femur fracture (e.g., comminuted, simple) may influence the choice of tibial component.

- **Alignment and Stability**: Ensure that the tibial component aligns properly with the femoral component to maintain joint stability and function.

- **Trial Components**: Use trial components to assess fit, leg length, and joint stability before finalizing the choice of the tibial component.

By evaluating these factors, the surgical team can select the most appropriate tibial component for optimal patient outcomes.

QUESTION-ANSWER PAIR 22

QUESTION:
Based on the document titled GMRS Distal Femur and Revision Baseplate Surgical Protocol from Stryker, answer this question:

If I can’t get diaphyseal fixation in the femur, what are the options?

ANSWER:
If you cannot achieve diaphyseal fixation in the femur, the following options can be considered:

1. **Use of Diaphyseal Augments**: Diaphyseal augments can be placed either intra- or extramedullary at the level of the osteotomy. This provides additional support and stability to the construct.

2. **Cemented Stems**: If diaphyseal fixation is not possible, consider using cemented stems to secure the implant. This involves applying bone cement to the femoral canal to enhance stability.

3. **Evaluate Alternative Fixation Methods**: Depending on the specific situation, alternative fixation methods such as using plates or external fixators may be considered to provide additional stability.

4. **Soft Tissue Reconstruction**: Ensure that soft tissue coverage is adequate. If significant soft tissue has been resected, mobilizing remaining musculature may be necessary to achieve proper coverage around the prosthesis.

5. **Consideration of Bone Quality**: If the bone quality is poor, additional measures may be needed to ensure stability, such as using larger or more robust components.

These options should be evaluated based on the specific clinical scenario, the patient's anatomy, and the surgeon's experience and preference.

QUESTION-ANSWER PAIR 23

QUESTION:
Based on the document titled GMRS Distal Femur and Revision Baseplate Surgical Protocol from Stryker, answer this question:

When should a distal femoral replacement be used or considered?

ANSWER:
If the knee does not fully extend, the following steps should be evaluated to change the construct:

1. **Assess Soft Tissue Tension**: Place the knee in extension and evaluate the soft tissue tension. This assessment is crucial to determine if the tension is contributing to the lack of full extension.

2. **Select Appropriate Tibial Bearing**: Choose a tibial bearing that allows for full extension but does not exceed 8 mm of joint distraction when longitudinal traction is applied in full extension.

3. **Trial Components**: Use trial components to ensure proper fit and interaction of all components. This includes inserting the trial axle through the condyles to fully capture the construct.

4. **Hyperflex the Knee**: In some cases, hyperflexing the knee with the patella everted may help articulate the tibial and femoral components properly.

5. **Adjust Component Heights**: If necessary, adjust the heights of the tibial bearing or femoral component to improve alignment and function.

6. **Final Assessment**: After making adjustments, re-evaluate the knee's range of motion and stability to ensure that the changes have resolved the extension issue.

### Modifications to the Bumper:
In this scenario, you can also consider the following with the bumper:

- **Adjust Bumper Height**: Modify the height of the bumper to provide better support and alignment for the patella, which can help alleviate the recurvatum.

- **Evaluate Bumper Design**: If the current bumper design is not providing adequate support, consider using a different bumper that may offer better stability and alignment.

By implementing these steps and modifications, you can address the issue of limited knee extension effectively.
