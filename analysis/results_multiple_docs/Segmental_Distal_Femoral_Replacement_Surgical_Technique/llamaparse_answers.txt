QUESTION-ANSWER PAIR 18

QUESTION:
Based on the document titled Segmental Distal Femoral Replacement Surgical Technique from Zimmer Biomet, answer this question:

If the knee does not fully extend, what are the steps we evaluate to change the construct?

ANSWER:
If the knee does not fully extend, the following steps should be evaluated to change the construct:

QUESTION-ANSWER PAIR 21

QUESTION:
Based on the document titled Segmental Distal Femoral Replacement Surgical Technique from Zimmer Biomet, answer this question:

What are the choices for the tibial component in the setting of a distal femur fracture? How do I decide which is the best option?

ANSWER:
In the setting of a distal femur fracture, the choices for the tibial component include:

1. **Short Non-Modular Tibial Component**: A fixed-length component that does not allow for adjustments.
2. **Modular Tibial Component without a Stem**: This option allows for some flexibility in assembly but does not include a stem for additional fixation.
3. **Long Non-Modular Tibial Component**: Similar to the short non-modular option but provides a longer length for different anatomical needs.
4. **Modular Tibial Component with a Stem**: This option provides the most flexibility and stability, allowing for adjustments and better fixation.

To decide which is the best option, consider the following factors:

- **Fracture Characteristics**: Assess the type and extent of the distal femur fracture. More complex fractures may benefit from the stability provided by a modular component with a stem.
- **Patient Anatomy**: Evaluate the patient's anatomy and the amount of remaining bone. If there is significant bone loss, a modular option with a stem may provide better support.
- **Surgical Goals**: Consider the goals of the surgery, including the desired range of motion and stability of the knee joint postoperatively.
- **Soft Tissue Integrity**: Assess the condition of the surrounding soft tissues, as this may influence the choice of tibial component.

By evaluating these factors, you can determine the most appropriate tibial component for the specific clinical scenario.

QUESTION-ANSWER PAIR 22

QUESTION:
Based on the document titled Segmental Distal Femoral Replacement Surgical Technique from Zimmer Biomet, answer this question:

If I can’t get diaphyseal fixation in the femur, what are the options?

ANSWER:
If diaphyseal fixation in the femur cannot be achieved, the following options may be considered:

1. **Use of Cemented Stems**: If adequate bone quality is not available for mechanical fixation, cemented stems can provide stability. Ensure proper alignment and remove excess cement from the junction between the stem collar and bone.

2. **Intercalary Constructs**: Consider using an intercalary construct that can bridge the gap between the proximal and distal femur. This construct can be secured with locking pins and cement to enhance stability.

3. **Soft Tissue Reconstruction**: If there is inadequate soft tissue coverage due to previous resections, mobilizing remaining musculature may be necessary to achieve proper coverage around the prosthesis.

4. **Alternative Fixation Techniques**: Depending on the specific clinical scenario, alternative fixation methods such as using plates or external fixators may be considered to provide additional support.

5. **Evaluate for Additional Procedures**: In some cases, additional surgical procedures may be necessary to enhance fixation or stability, such as bone grafting or the use of adjunctive devices.

These options should be evaluated based on the individual patient's anatomy, the extent of the fracture, and the overall surgical plan.

QUESTION-ANSWER PAIR 23

QUESTION:
Based on the document titled Segmental Distal Femoral Replacement Surgical Technique from Zimmer Biomet, answer this question:

When should a distal femoral replacement be used or considered?

ANSWER:
A distal femoral replacement should be used or considered in the following situations:

1. **Bone Tumors**: When there is a need to resect a portion of the distal femur due to primary bone sarcoma or metastatic disease.

2. **Severe Fractures**: In cases of complex or non-union fractures of the distal femur where traditional fixation methods are inadequate.

3. **Significant Bone Loss**: When there is substantial bone loss in the distal femur that cannot be adequately addressed with other reconstructive techniques.

4. **Failed Previous Surgeries**: In situations where previous surgical interventions have failed, leading to instability or deformity in the distal femur.

5. **Intraoperative Findings**: If intraoperative assessment reveals that the remaining bone is insufficient for stable fixation or reconstruction.

It is important to carefully review the indications and contraindications for use, as well as to conduct thorough pre-operative planning to determine the correct implant components and sizes.

QUESTION:
Based on the document titled Segmental Distal Femoral Replacement Surgical Technique from Zimmer Biomet, answer this question:

What can I do with the distal femoral component if I can’t close the retinaculum?

ANSWER:
If you cannot close the retinaculum after placing the distal femoral component, consider the following options:

1. **Evaluate Soft Tissue Tension**: Place the knee in extension and assess the soft tissue tension around the joint. This evaluation helps determine if the tension is contributing to the inability to close the retinaculum.

2. **Adjust Component Positioning**: Reassess the alignment and positioning of the tibial and femoral components. Ensure that the components are positioned to minimize tension on the retinaculum.

3. **Suture Techniques**: Use sutures to reattach any available soft tissue structures to the appropriate anatomical locations, which can help provide additional support and stability.

4. **Consider Closing with Knee in Extension**: If soft tissue integrity is compromised, consider closing the wound with the knee in full extension to minimize tension on the retinaculum.

QUESTION-ANSWER PAIR 27

QUESTION:
Based on the document titled Segmental Distal Femoral Replacement Surgical Technique from Zimmer Biomet, answer this question:

Is this a central femoral hinge or posterior consular hinge? Which has better quad efficiency and lower dislocation rate?

ANSWER:
The document does not explicitly specify whether the system uses a central femoral hinge or a posterior condylar hinge. However, in general orthopedic practice:

- **Posterior Condylar Hinges** are often associated with better quadriceps efficiency and lower dislocation rates compared to central femoral hinges. This is due to the anatomical alignment and biomechanics that allow for more natural movement and stability during flexion and extension.

For specific information regarding the hinge type used in the Zimmer Biomet segmental distal femoral replacement and their comparative performance, it may be necessary to consult additional resources or product specifications from Zimmer Biomet.
