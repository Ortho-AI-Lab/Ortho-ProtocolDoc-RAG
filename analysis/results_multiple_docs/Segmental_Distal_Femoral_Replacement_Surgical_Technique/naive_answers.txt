QUESTION-ANSWER PAIR 22

QUESTION:
Based on the document titled Segmental Distal Femoral Replacement Surgical Technique from Zimmer Biomet, answer this question:

If I can’t get diaphyseal fixation in the femur, what are the options?

ANSWER:
If diaphyseal fixation in the femur cannot be achieved, the following options can be considered:

1. **Use of Diaphyseal Augments**: Diaphyseal augments can be placed either intra- or extramedullary at the level of the osteotomy. This can help provide additional support and stability to the construct.

2. **Select Appropriate Augment Size and Type**: Choose the size and type of augment based on the defect or bone void. Use the corresponding sized augment reamer for preparation.

QUESTION:
Based on the document titled Segmental Distal Femoral Replacement Surgical Technique from Zimmer Biomet, answer this question:

What can I do with the distal femoral component if I can’t close the retinaculum?

ANSWER:
If you cannot close the retinaculum after placing the distal femoral component, consider the following options:

1. **Evaluate Soft Tissue Tension**: Place the knee in extension and assess the soft tissue tension. This evaluation is crucial to determine if the tension is contributing to the inability to close the retinaculum.

2. **Hyperflex the Knee**: Hyperflex the knee with the patella everted to help articulate the tibial and femoral components properly. This can assist in assessing the fit and function of the components.

3. **Adjust Component Positioning**: Ensure that the tibial and femoral components are properly aligned. Misalignment can contribute to difficulties in closing the retinaculum.

4. **Consider Soft Tissue Mobilization**: If there is significant soft tissue tension, mobilizing the remaining musculature may be necessary to achieve proper coverage around the prosthesis.

5. **Use of a Knee Brace**: If soft tissue integrity is inadequate, consider using a knee brace postoperatively to limit flexion and provide additional support.

QUESTION-ANSWER PAIR 27

QUESTION:
Based on the document titled Segmental Distal Femoral Replacement Surgical Technique from Zimmer Biomet, answer this question:

Is this a central femoral hinge or posterior consular hinge? Which has better quad efficiency and lower dislocation rate?

ANSWER:
The document does not explicitly specify whether the system uses a central femoral hinge or a posterior condylar hinge. However, in general orthopedic practice:

- **Central Femoral Hinge**: Typically provides better quadriceps efficiency due to its design, which allows for more natural knee mechanics and better alignment with the quadriceps muscle.

- **Posterior Condylar Hinge**: May have a lower dislocation rate in certain cases due to its design that can provide more stability in the knee joint.

To determine which option is best, consider the following factors:

1. **Patient Anatomy**: Assess the patient's knee anatomy and any previous surgeries that may affect stability.

2. **Functional Requirements**: Evaluate the patient's activity level and functional needs, as this may influence the choice of hinge design.

3. **Surgeon's Experience**: The surgeon's familiarity with either hinge type can also guide the decision.

4. **Trial Components**: Use trial components to assess fit and function before finalizing the choice of hinge design.

Ultimately, the choice between a central femoral hinge and a posterior condylar hinge should be based on a comprehensive evaluation of the patient's specific needs and the surgical team's expertise.
