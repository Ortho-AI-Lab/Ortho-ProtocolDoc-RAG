Question: How long is the distal femoral component?
Answer: According to the surgical protocol, the distal femoral component comes in two sizes:

Small: 
- M/L width: 52mm
- A/P length: 45mm

Standard:
- M/L width: 60mm 
- A/P length: 54mm

The specific length needed would depend on which size (small or standard) is selected based on the patient's anatomy.
